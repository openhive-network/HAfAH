  test_name: Hivemind condenser_api.get_discussions_by_promoted patterns test

  marks:
    - patterntest # order in original when promotion amount was equal was basically random, so posts are ordered differently
                  # note post /life/@thecryptofiend/things-i-wish-i-d-known-when-i-was-18
                  # it is in the results despite not having 'steemit' in 'tags'
                  # it is because the post was edited and was changing tags - we don't clear old tags during edit (should be fixed at some point)
                  # compared to original extra votes are due to removed vote muting
