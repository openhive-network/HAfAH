  test_name: Hivemind condenser_api.get_following last patterns test

  marks:
    - patterntest # original didn't allow skipping params (.orig created with all params passed), also
                  # original always included page defining account in results (and order of follows created in the same time was basically random), that was corrected

  includes:
    - !include ../../../common.yaml
