    "body": "\"Yes,\" I said.\n\" Yes is your name?\" asked the teacher as everyone around me laughed.\n\"..Uhm\"\n\"Is there something wrong with you?\"\nI think NO and YES but MAYBE. I closed my eyes and tried very hard to disappear into thin air.\n\n----\n\nThat's how my high-school started, first math hour and the master implementation of my plan to \"hear better\". Having had meningitis as a kid, my hearing was *royally fucked and utterly unfixable*. The left ear was basically dead and the right one with deep nerve damage, *I KNEW* that I couldn't hear better, at least physically. But I schemed and designed strategies to work around it, minimize, ignore and neglect this disadvantage. It was the only way.\n\nLike a magician, I tried to bring people into my world. I've created my own mirrors, I've brought my own smoke: I was paying more attention than everyone, I was reading the body language like a wizard studying arcane texts, I was guessing what people will say before they even started. I was a step ahead. At least in my world where the God was named **Raz**.\n<center> http://shirtigo.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/awesomenessarcher.jpg </center>\n<center> *There were times when I felt like that...*</center>\n<br>\nTo bring this world to be, I had to control the situation, the environment, the message. I had to monopolize the conversation while simultaneously make people enjoy the monopole. That's a lot harder than it seems.\nI always had to have a good story to tell, a funny thing to mention, a way to talk about nothing until time ended and a supernova ate us all. The less I had to listen, the less was not to hear, right?\n\nAnd so, I persevered. I did my homework and worked on my stories, my style, my delivery. I studied what missed and took it off the repertoire, added new stuff and continually testing and testing, furbishing each bit to perfection. I wasn't aware that this is what stand-up comedians do with every show.\nIt worked surprisingly well. It worked amazingly easy. **It worked until it didn't**.\n\n\n --- **at this point some of your might see where this is going, I'm sorry I didn't** ---\n\n\nThe fact of the matter was that my hearing did not work so whenever people did participate in this ongoing charade of mine, I was at risk. That was the second part of my plan. Usually, I was able to gather the essential and I tried to imagine the rest. I can't tell you how many imagined conversations I had, filling the silent blank with concoctions of my own mind. I danced around the specifics I invented and dove deep into the general until I knew - based on body language, or response - that I was on the subject. Then, I went back to specifics. The person left with the impression that we had a real conversation.\n**I was left exhausted.** \n\nWhile I was happy that this worked, I was also judging everyone for not seeing through my subterfuges. I wanted people to say \" Enough of this!\" and when they didn't, I felt victorious, *a joker*, a god, a fool, nothing at all.  Little did I know, my ways were slowly giving me the impostor syndrome.\n\nBut of course, whenever I felt too full of myself I was reminded that I am, always, **a handicapped**. No matter what I did, I could never be ready for spontaneity. A quick unexpected question. A witty remark. Anything that seemed to come out of nowhere, as spontaneity does and  boom, I was lost. Sucker punched by ingenuity and fun, I was trying to figure what to say next: admit defeat or risk saying something wise, maybe laugh, maybe a  chuckle?. I used to do that, laugh and say \"yeah\" until someone once said - i found out later - that their grandfather was in the hospital. Apparently, we were talking about something somewhat related. *My laughter was not forgiven.*\n\n<center> https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/ancNOQb.jpg </center>\n<center> *Me, right, in high school* </center>\n<br>\n\nAnd so, I was forced to face the thing I feared the most: **uncertainty**. This is the real cancer of being hearing impaired, you're always on your toes, always on guard and never ready. It slowly creeps into everything, every action(am i doing this right?), every answer(i hope this is ok) and eventually: yourself. It takes over your soul and fills it with unanswerable questions: *\"AM I OK?\"*, *\"DOES ANYONE CARES?\"**\nConfidence and self-esteem praised as foundation bricks of every successful individual, cower in a corner for me. I was left fighting with weapons without ammo and had to fake the confidence of Rambo. It wasn't ideal.\n\nPeople evolved with the tribe mentality, different wasn't good, different was dangerous and I believe we have an immense capability of sniffing out \"different\". No matter what, how, or how well is hidden, you detect something is askew. Even if you don't know what: does he talk too fast? Is that a bizarre accent? There's a certain weird fluidity about his movements? You hear people say \" My gut instinct told me something was wrong..\" and they were probably right.\nYes, today, the ads are yelling at us *\"BE DIFFERENT!\"* or *\"DARE TO BE DIFFERENT!!!\"* but the subtext is, be different in drinking Pepsi vs Coke, not give up soda altogether you weirdo! Be different but not **TOO** Different. \n\nWalking around the high-school, I felt the \"different\" sign burned in my DNA, my movements, my answers and even my word choices singled me out. I felt like I was signaling my anomaly everywhere. But I carried on, *what else was I to do?*\n\n\n\n***end of part 1.***",

    "body": "I am basically an urban guy and would not, at least at this point in life, think about living in the country. Though there are some advantages \u2013 *grow your own food, low cost of living* \u2013 the trade-offs are just not worth it for me. For now I like the city, even if it is crowded. I live in a decent apartment in a decent area, and I like the shops and restaurants, bars and theaters, cinemas, music venues and whatnot.  Anyway my job is not *work-from-home*, which would help, I assume, for someone to live in the country, where there are no engineering jobs. *So this is not a story about me.*\n\nThat being said I have, like many others, a strange interest in the so-called *pastoral way of life*, simple and closer to nature. The rhythms of life are different, the pace is slower, and things are more settled. Or, so it seems to the urban dweller, who probably does not understand the reality of country living. Like waking up at 6 in the morning during a hailstorm if you have livestock to feed. \n\n<center>http://epochtimes-romania.com/news_images/2015/05/2015_05_25_satulbiertan_rsz_crp.jpeg</center>\n<center> Most of the countryside is not like this</center>\n\n\nThe Romanian countryside is not like the British of French countryside. It is somewhat *more primitive and poorer,* and with a different feel. There are picturesque villages in Romania, where life goes on in almost timeless fashion and this is what tourists come to see, but more of it is definitely not like that. It is, like many rural areas poor, plagued with *bad infrastructure, alcoholism and other afflictions*. \n\nSo, moving to the country in Romania, Merry Olde England it is not. But some people still do it. Why? The change in pace, the change in rhythm, the longing for a different way of life. This is a powerful driving force for many.\n\nRomania was always behind the times compared to Western Europe, and more rural. There was rapid urbanization and industrialization during communism, but, like all things imposed by force by the communist government, *it was, in the long term, a disaster*. The inefficient industry collapsed, the people who moved to the cities often felt alienated. The cities were, for many, quite shitty.\n\n<center>http://scms.machteamsoft.ro/uploads/photos/652x450/652x450_016506-blocuri-comuniste.jpg</center>\n\nWhy do I say the cities were shitty? Crowded, with bad, hastily created infrastructure, and hideous brutalist architecture. They were not created for good living. Housing was usually in cramped, badly insulated apartment in endless concrete apartment blocks. Romania has many jokes about apartment living and bad neighbors, which you could hear through the thin walls. There was no feeling of community.\n\nBucharest has a *lot going for it*. Jobs, decent wages, culture, growth. It is fairly dynamic and alive. But it is also crowded, polluted and noisy. \n\nIn Bucharest, the apartment buildings are very close to each other, with few green areas. The streets are small and crowded; the parking is a big problem. And there are lots of cars. One reason would be the fairly inefficient public transportation, but another the fact that after communism where having a car was difficult and sort of a status symbol, everyone wanted a car, even if it is mostly parked. The jobs are not where the apartments are, so commuting is a nightmare, some of the worst traffic in the world in this city. The air quality is bad, the noise is bad.\n\n<center>http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/image-2015-11-18-20601721-0-masini-parcate-trotuar.jpg</center>\n\nOver all this came the fact that Romania had one of the most epic housing bubbles in the world, and a lot of people were convinced to \u201cbuy now, things will only get more expensive.\u201d Romanians are not renter at heart, the all want to own a home. So they bought. With 30 year credits, mostly denominated in foreign currency, without understanding credit risk and with variable interest rates to boot. Variable, as in whatever the bank felt like. It was a disaster in the making. \n\nAnd then, the market tanked, and the currency tanked, and the credits became unbearable. And this is where the appeal of a simpler, rural life comes strong from. You had a shitty little concrete box in a hideous apartment block, a credit and a 2 hour a day commute. This is when the country really seems attractive.\n\n<center>http://mediartv1.freenode.ro/image/201308/full/bucuresti-trafic_27331700.jpg</center>\n\nRomanians have a strange expression. *\u201cA little house on the ground\u201d* or maybe *on the land or on the dirt* would be better translations. Anyway. It means well \u2026 **not an apartment**, but a house with maybe a small yard, and no neighbors above and below. It is a dream for most, and an unachievable one at that, in the city.\n\nBut maybe in the country where this is cheaper, maybe a small vegetable garden to grow my own food. Maybe a bit of break from the constant honking of horns (and believe you me, Romanians love honking their goddamn car horns), maybe air that is a little more breathable. It is simply a wish to get rid of the bank, the commute.\n\nWill it work for most? No. Of course not. But it is something that I see more often around me\n\n*Note: Images sourced from - Romanian news websites*",

IS THERE A PURPOSE TO IT ALL?</strong></em></p>\n<p>People have longed and desired for millennia over the answers to these most fundamental of questions about human existence. Not only do people want concrete answers to their existential questions, but simple, neat explanations are sought after to define all the aspects of life. The very fact of not having an answer to a question can leave one with immense anxiety, stress, and emptiness. People fear that which they do not know, especially when it comes to one\u2019s self or environment. As a result, people, ideologies, and sciences of external origin always appear, claiming to fill the void and give concreteness to an otherwise confusing and unknown universe. We not only celebrate and accept these external explanations as facts of truth, but the people propagating them are often looked up to as idols and leaders in which the people can put faith.</p>\n<p>As they grow in popularity and acceptance, people find strength and security in numbers. Independent thinking is far too complicated and takes far too much time, especially when caught up in the&nbsp;non-stop rat race many of us call reality. Emotions and thoughts can run volatile while venturing down the rabbit hole and out into the wild west of the unknown, exposing one to <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/false-flag-alert-realitys-been-hacked/\">mysterious realities</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/conspiracy-conspiracy-theories/\">inverse truths </a>that often come away shattering paradigms. This is both scary and risky, especially at first, exposing one to heightened levels of vulnerability. Concreteness is a far more comfortable and secure way to navigate this complex world. Knowing is also seen as a sign of strength and confidence in society, while not knowing is perceived as weakness and uneducated. Yet, is this&nbsp;actually a trap, and nothing more than a deceptive spell on human perception?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/ij72koddj/Alice_04.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"498\"/></p>\n<p><strong>THE TRAP:</strong></p>\n<p>Knowing has an&nbsp;intrinsic relationship with words such as concreteness, filled, closed, fixed, action, controlled, positive, full, and physical. When the perception of an idea is known, it is essentially an ideology that is set in the mind, in that it is a strong neural pattern of connection in the brain that is fully perceived consciously as right and true. There is no need to question the reality of that idea because it is fully hardened and understood as a fixed truth. Effectively, one shapes a paradigm around that idea, always experiencing the consciousness of that idea through that particular lens or filter. It\u2019s as if one\u2019s mind gets placed in a box with clear parameters and edges to define the \u201ctrue\u201d shape of the idea. In a sense, the belief appears whole and fully understood.</p>\n<p>Once a box is placed around an idea, all new information is filtered through the lens and understanding of that \u201cconcrete\u201d truth, rendering one unable to see past their preconceived box of beliefs to contemplate the existence of an alternate reality. They don\u2019t know that they don\u2019t know the picture might be a flawed illusion. When an idea becomes so wholly concrete, new information about the idea that can\u2019t be easily explained through the current lens, is then either, distorted by the mind to fit inside the current box, or completely ignored as if it doesn\u2019t even exist. This is where the defense mechanism of fear and denial manifests from, often leading to the programmed responses of blind overconfidence or scared obedience. Ignorance is bliss right?</p>\n<p>This right here is the trap in its full form, and one that everyone falls into to some degree or another throughout life. The problem is, many fall all the way in, especially on such fundamental ideas, and never come out to question. Faith is confidently placed in an ideological belief, blinding one to the unknown possibility lying just beyond the perceived concreteness on reality. The mind, both logically and intuitively, is then completely shut off and full, stunting the possibility of any learning, growth and evolution from being added to the mix when it comes to the belief system of that idea. This is the fallacy of misplaced concreteness and is arguably one of the most dangerous spells upon human perception. This concreteness that isn\u2019t really there, is nothing more than a subtle and hidden form of mind control that\u2019s highly misunderstood by the public, leaving most subjectively unaware of its existence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/ntc1byxmf/Modern_Day_Mind_Control_Overview.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"/></p>\n<p><strong>MIND CONTROL:</strong></p>\n<p>When something is under control, it lacks the ability to authentically change or exercise free will. In fact, freedom and control are language opposites. Once one\u2019s mind is stuck in an ideological box, it becomes completely vulnerable and loyal to whatever controls and represents it, essentially a slave to its parameters. This control on the human mind can stem from two areas, one\u2019s own mind, or from the external environment. In a sense, one can mind control themselves or allow an external force to mind control them.</p>\n<p>At a certain point, everyone falls prey to the mind control of an external force. In society today, the amount of external ideological boxes runs extremely deep, branching into all of religion, science, philosophy, politics, history, social relationships, brands, entertainment, media, culture, and just information in general. All these different disciplines are the same in that they claim to give concrete answers to various ideas and phenomenon. They not only attempt to explain the outside world, but they also come to help define our own subjective experience, including one\u2019s personality and belief system.</p>\n<p>This is extremely concerning, in that one is giving up their sovereign ability to perceive reality to an external force in which they did not create or control. At that point they become nothing but sheep, herded into a box that\u2019s defined by some external entity. It\u2019s a widely growing&nbsp;opinion that <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/understanding-the-new-world-order/\">people in positions of power</a> have knowingly created ideological boxes to herd the masses into for centuries. Ideologies/mind control are the best way to indirectly control the masses in order for the powerful to keep in power and expand their influence.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s14.postimg.org/uy7cn5owx/7922e97de4a33bb5cecb689a223783e8.jpg\" width=\"564\" height=\"317\"/></p>\n<p>When the mainstream boxes don\u2019t work and people begin to escape the illusion, they only create new and more nuanced boxes&nbsp;in which to&nbsp;herd the masses, to keep up with the times. This can be described as controlled opposition, and a big part of the <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/we-have-the-same-enemy-yet-were-all-divided/\">Hegelian dialect</a>; a technique for social control, which involves one group controlling all the views of an idea and playing them off each other for a particular purpose. This can be even more hazardous, in that those that escaped often think they are making a free choice. The best example is the same group controlling both the left and right of politics as well as independent movements like the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.globalresearch.ca/why-are-corporate-groups-funding-the-tea-party/18677&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjomNmDp-TJAhXLOxoKHfCbAT8QFggKMAI&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6JpYH-BLTt67FaSfTmq-o6CkLzA\">Tea Party</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/here-s-the-risk-occupy-ends-up-doing-the-bidding-of-the-global-elite/27708\">Occupy Wall Street</a>, playing them as pawns against&nbsp;each other to fulfill an agenda, giving people the illusion of opposition and choice, while deterring people away from the real root problems.</p>\n<p>Similarly, people can just as easily fall victim to mind control of their own creation. Usually unintentionally, they create a concrete reality for which they won\u2019t let anything new break apart. This often happens when one has a subjective experience that they then take and perceive to be a concrete truth, since they did indeed experience it first-hand. For example, if someone has a bad experience learning math when they are in school, they will often go long periods of time thinking and believing that they don\u2019t like math and math sucks. This is done with all ideas, from political beliefs and historical facts to scientific understandings and personal beliefs of self.</p>\n<p>Are these subjective experiences really concrete truths, or just illusions of misplaced concreteness? Many people mistake their childhood and even later into their adult years as forms of concreteness, especially when it comes to defining their personalities and \u201cthe way things work.\u201d This is worrisome because many people are not even fully conscious in their younger years. If one never questions the concrete reality one perceives, then logically one is under a subtle form of mind control, stubbornly unable to see past their perceived concrete beliefs. They constantly distort the truth to fit their current lens and remain blind in order to maintain the status quo that is their paradigm on reality.</p>\n<p>However, what happens when one begins to wake-up and question, re-analyzing all the ideological boxes in which they thought were a fixed part of reality? What happens when one wanders out of the box into the great unknown?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s13.postimg.org/yrnau5m7r/Fallacy_of_concreteness.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/></p>\n<p><strong>INFINITE AWARENESS AND INFINITE POSSIBILITY:</strong></p>\n<p>Not knowing is intrinsically comparable to fluid, void, open, malleable, inaction, free, negative, empty, and non-physical. When someone doesn\u2019t know something, reality is not fixed or set, but instead open and free to take any and all forms. As stated earlier, not having an answer can be a very stressful and uncomfortable way to walk through life, especially when society equates intelligence and confidence with having concrete answers. Many people will also claim, \u201cWell there are facts in life and there isn\u2019t, so why be open to things that have been proven wrong?\u201d Again, this is all part of the trap and just a spell aimed to put human perception in a fixed box.</p>\n<p>The point and secret seems to be remaining open and operating always in a state of not knowing. In this regard, one is then able to see fully into the box and explore its contents without falling all the way in. The moment one falls into the trap of having concrete beliefs, is the moment one\u2019s mind stagnates. It\u2019s not to say that there are not patterns in the universe that appear frequently, because indeed there seem to be, but it\u2019s the idea of being able to see these patterns and adopt them without becoming a slave to any of them. When one&nbsp;chooses not to hold concrete truths, the possibility of growth and evolution of patterns is infinitely possible throughout one\u2019s life. The intention is to observe and study patterns, yet always still operating in a state of unknown and questioning. This allows dialectal thinking to take place, in which one can view all the angles of an idea, instead of just one or two, to come to a current theory. All the fields of human understanding would have never evolved had people not chose to leave the current box of understanding and think differently and independently outside of it. In fact, it is often the stubbornness of the mainstream culture and its current understandings which hold us back from further <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/health/enlightenment/\">Enlightenment</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s11.postimg.org/czer57xar/bigstock_open_mind_key_locked_un_locked_11862878.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"738\"/></p>\n<p>Although not a perfect analogy, taking in information and determining definition is like throwing spaghetti against the wall. Some stuff sticks for a long time, others stick for only a period of time before falling off, while others simply fall off right away. This is the best theory I can conceive of thus far of how consciousness grows. One will never know of this new information and reach a higher state of awareness until one is open and vulnerable to the idea of change; understanding&nbsp;that&nbsp;nothing in reality is actually concrete. It is only a pattern that is constantly flowing and changing. Once someone undergoes a complete ego death of all concreteness, one can experience a <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/eight-signs-world-undergoing-paradigm-shift/\">paradigm shift</a>, finally allowing them access to the infinite awareness and enter the state of constant growth.</p>\n<p>The old saying goes, \u201cEnlightenment is knowing how much you don\u2019t know.\u201d Don\u2019t ever let your perception fall victim to the fallacy of misplaced concreteness. <a href=\"http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/featured/the-authentic-producer/\">Take back control of your mind</a> and never let anyone trap it, including the fear and denial of your own manifestation. The goal is not a destination, but instead an undefined path towards truth where there is always room for growth, re-evaluation, and evolution. Strangely enough, it is the intuition, for which cannot be explained in a 5 sense reality or scientific materialism, that guides us through the realm of the unknown and into infinite awareness and infinite possibility.

I then proceeded to talk about the first 5 of the Top-10 most \u2018ridiculous\u2019 psychiatric disorders as taken directly from the DSM-5 manual. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/mentalhospitalcomc832a.jpg\" width=\"632\" height=\"464\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.mentalhospital.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>In this article (PART 2) I will talk about the last 5 most controversial psychiatric diseases and at the end I will briefly explain why I have such a problem with how Psychiatry diagnoses its patients today by shortly presenting to you two real psychiatric patients which I had the chance to meet during my Psychiatry rotation back in medical school. But first, here is the second part of my Top-10 most ridiculous and controversial psychiatric disorders: &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/flickrcom5f0e9.jpg\" width=\"478\" height=\"677\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.pixabay.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Try to picture a typical 8 year old boy. His main priority in life is to have fun, run around, jump up and down \u2013 even in places where it might be inappropriate to do so. He loves to play, sometimes very loudly, and it seems to be impossible to make him sit quietly, even for a bit. On social events he is very hard to control and he needs constant discipline by his parents. Playing with his friends is his favorite thing to do and that\u2019s probably the only reason why he goes to school, reluctantly some times. His teachers keep saying that he is a smart kid, but he needs to try and focus more on his school work. They had to discipline him a few times because his homework was full of mistakes or sometimes he would forget doing it completely! His parents can definitely believe his teachers since at home he acts pretty much the same way. He hates cleaning his room, or doing any other chores that his parents make him do. &nbsp;Sometimes when they try to talk to him about his responsibilities, he appears like he is not really listening. His mind seems to be somewhere else and the next day he always forgets everything his parents tried to teach him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have just described to you a \u2018typical\u2019 child. But what if I had asked a psychologist to describe to us a \u2018typical\u2019 child with ADHD? According to the DSM-5, his description would look pretty much the same as the text above. Everything I included in that text is listed as a diagnostic criterion for ADHD. Of course, just like for most psychiatric illnesses, the symptoms must create significant problems in the patient\u2019s life. But in this case, this decision is based on the subjective opinion of the parents who are usually asked to \u2018rate\u2019 on a scale of 1 to 5 how much, they think, each symptom is affecting their child\u2019s life. It is believed that up to 10% of children today could potentially be diagnosed with ADHD and given a long-term prescription of Ritalin. If that doesn\u2019t worry you enough, the American Psychiatric Association, in the revised DSM-5 criteria, has increased the maximum age for diagnosis from 6 to 12. The result \u2013 even more children can now be labelled as psychiatric patients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Intermittent Explosive Disorder</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/pixabaycom2020ea.jpg\" width=\"698\" height=\"518\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.pixabay.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>If you have temper tantrums, anger outbursts or get involved in verbal arguments twice per week and your \u2018aggressive impulses\u2019 are \u2018out of proportion\u2019 then you could be suffering from this disorder. The generalization used to describe the symptoms of this \u2018disease\u2019 allows for the subjective interpretation of the Psychiatrists to be the main deciding factor which will distinguish the healthy from the sick. Even though your \u2018twice per week\u2019 anger issues will probably just put you in psychotherapy they could also potentially give you a prescription of mood stabilizers, antidepressants and anxiolytics. Side effects of such drugs include anxiety, emotional blunting, sexual dysfunction, nausea, vomiting, heart rhythm abnormalities, increased risk of dying from bleeding and suicidal thoughts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Personality Disorders</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/pixabaycom5c2ba.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.pixabay.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Another great example of Psychiatry\u2019s \u2018one disorder for each individual\u2019 way of thinking. Currently there 10 different personality disorders and I am sure most humans can fit under at least one of them. They define a Personality Disorder as \u2018an enduring pattern of inner experience or behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual\u2019s culture\u2019. In other words, instead of encouraging humans to live in a world where free thinking and individuality are valued the most, they tell you that if the ways you think or behave are different than everyone else\u2019s around you, then you could be mentally ill. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Personality Disorders are currently divided into three different \u2018Clusters\u2019. Cluster A includes the paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal types and according to the DSM-5 \u2018patients\u2019 in this group generally appear as \u2018odd or eccentric\u2019. If your way of thinking and behaving is \u2018dramatic, emotional or erratic\u2019 then you probably have a Cluster B personality disorder or more specifically one of antisocial, borderline, histrionic or narcissistic types. Finally, if you are generally an anxious or fearful person then you could be suffering from the avoidant, dependent, or obsessive-compulsive types of Personality Disorders, all part of Cluster C. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your psychiatrist suspects that you might have a Personality Disorder but he is not really sure in which specific category you belong to, the DSM-5 has the answer. \u2018General Personality Disorder\u2019 is listed in the DSM-5 as a separate disorder and it is for those who either don\u2019t fit in a specific Cluster or they show signs of multiple Personality Disorders. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Transvestic Disorder</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/wikipediacom87d42.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"560\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.wikipedia.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>There is something about the diagnosis of Paraphilias that really annoys me. Perhaps it is the hypocrisy of the DSM-5 which first labels someone\u2019s - different than \u2018normal\u2019 - sexual desires as a mental disorder and then after they have told that person that he could possibly be mentally ill, they tell him: \u2018oh, but don\u2019t worry, you can only be diagnosed if you feel distressed about it\u2019. I can understand the reason behind including Paedophilia in the DSM-5 but I think that putting next to it something called \u2018Transvestic Disorder\u2019 is a disgrace to say the least.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imagine a young male, probably in his teenage years, questioning his sexuality \u2013 even questioning his own gender. He has sexual fantasies about being a woman, sometimes he likes to dress as one and even to have sex as one. The society stereotypes make him feel different, like he doesn\u2019t belong with the rest of his peers. He probably gets bullied and according to statistics he is much more likely to be harassed, beaten and even raped than other \u2018normal\u2019 people. He decides to go to a psychiatrist to get some help, who despite the fact he may have good intentions, he has to diagnose him with a mental illness according to the \u2018Holy Book\u2019 of Psychiatry. Imagine now how difficult it will be for this person to ever feel normal and live his life as he chooses without emotions of guilt or distress. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Oppositional Defiant Disorder&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/nakedpastorcom3c3d6.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.nakedpastor.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>For some people, this is Psychiatry\u2019s biggest joke yet. The way the diagnostic criteria have been written, any disagreement with an individual or organization of authority is considered a mental illness. &nbsp;If you refuse to comply with the orders from an authority figure, if you don\u2019t follow the rules, or even if you get \u2018touchy\u2019 or \u2018annoyed\u2019 at their requests or even the thought of having to follow a rule you don\u2019t agree with, then you are a candidate for this diagnosis. As an adult, not following the rules at least once every week for 6 months is enough for a psychiatrist to diagnose you. I don\u2019t think I need to comment any further. Check the diagnostic criteria yourself. But be a good sheep and don\u2019t defy them, or else you will be declared mentally unstable. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Personal Experience: Two similar but also very different cases of Schizophrenia&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I could really keep this list going by talking about OCD, Tobacco Use Disorder, Factitious Disorder, Conduct disorder etc. But I will stop here and try to tell you quickly why I have such a problem with Psychiatry. Other than the obvious reasons which you can probably tell from reading this and my previous article, my problem also originates from an experience I had with two patients I met during my rotation in a Psychiatric hospital. Both patients, a man and a woman in their late 20s, were diagnosed with schizophrenia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/pixabaycom37b2c5.jpg\" width=\"896\" height=\"634\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"www.pixabay.com\"><em><strong>(Source)</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>I met the woman first. We hear very frequently the metaphorical expression about people being \u2018empty in their soul\u2019, but the first time I saw her, was the first time that I ever genuinely felt this about someone. The way she looked at me, her movement, the tone of her voice gave me an eerie, almost shocking feeling. But with the medication she was taking, her emotionless appearance wasn\u2019t really a surprise. After battling for years with severe depression, she started hearing voices, which told her daily how worthless she was and that no one in the world could ever love her. This is when she started receiving anti-psychotic medication in addition to her antidepressants. The voices went away for a while and things seemed to improve. But it wasn\u2019t long before her hallucinations returned - only this time they were as evil as they could get. A new voice started to speak within her head. It was telling her how death, which the patient referred to as \u2018the darkness\u2019 was so much better than the life she was living. It told her how all her problems would be solved and how all the horrible feelings would go away once she went \u2018to the darkness\u2019. Soon after its appearance, the voice told her to grab a blade and slit her wrists. The woman was found by her mother in a bathtub full with blood and it was by pure luck that she was saved. She showed me her scars and it was obvious that this wasn\u2019t just a cry for attention. It was a genuine attempt to put an end to her life. She was hospitalized and given more aggressive medication. Her condition improved but from what I learned, soon after the voices still returned. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then a few weeks later I met the male patient. He was a rather likable person, a bit awkward but definitely fun to talk to. Unlike the female patient, he never had problems with depression. He was given the diagnosis of Schizophrenia after he had various religious visions and \u2018encounters with God\u2019. He believed that the sun was the physical form of God and that the Sun would talk to him frequently telling him to live his life according to the words of God. This young man had no problems with his visions and the only reason he was in the hospital was because his parents made him come since they were worried about him. He was never aggressive or depressed, he never tried to harm himself or others, he had a couple of friends and he had just started working at a part-time job. Despite the fact that his hallucinations were generally harmless, he did mention feeling some minor anxiety and fear while experiencing them. That was enough for the Psychiatrist to admit him to the hospital to make sure he was no danger to \u2018himself or others\u2019. About two weeks later he was released with a prescription of powerful anti-psychotics. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two months later it was time for him to visit his psychiatrist again. I got permission to observe his session and I can say that I was rather excited to see him again since our first meeting was quite interesting and enjoyable. As soon as he opened the door, my eyes turned straight to him and to my shock, I saw in him the exact same \u2018emptiness\u2019, emotionless expression that I had seen the first time I met the female patient. The person he was before, was now well gone - one could say even 'dead'. &nbsp;I cannot say that this patient was \u2018normal\u2019 when I first met him, but he had an \u2018abnormality\u2019 which didn\u2019t really bother him and did not decrease in any way the quality of his life. He was just different. &nbsp;But now the pill cocktail which was given to \u2018heal\u2019 him had turned him into a different person, who appeared almost like a ghost of his previous self. I don\u2019t know how this patient turned out, but I can guarantee you that he is not the only one who has been through this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I understand that the human brain and the way it works are some of the biggest mysteries that Medicine has to deal with today. I am not trying to doubt the fact that Mental Disease can be real and debilitating. I am just arguing against Psychiatry\u2019s attempt to medicalize ordinary parts of human life and label the different as \u2018diseased\u2019. It widely offers therapy and most often pills as an \u2018easy way out\u2019 from difficult but still normal elements of life. &nbsp;Perhaps one day, when biological evidence for some mental illnesses will be discovered, Psychiatrists will turn to us and rightfully say \u2018We told you so\u2019. But until then, everyone involved in the field of Psychiatry should understand its limitations and change the way they diagnose and treat the mentally ill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>-CT.</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n<p><strong>Sources&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders <a href=\"http://www.institute4learning.com/articles/add_myth.php\">http://www.institute4learning.com/articles/add_myth.php</a> <a href=\"http://www.emergenceplus.org.uk/what-is-personality-disorder/92-why-are-personality-disorders-controversial-diagnoses.html\">http://www.emergenceplus.org.uk/what-is-personality-disorder/92-why-are-personality-disorders-controversial-diagnoses.html</a> http://www.wayneramsay.com/diagnosis.htm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n<p>For more articles like this but also on many other subjects, follow me <a href=\"https://steemit.com/@nulliusinverba\">@nulliusinverba</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/10/http---signatures.mylivesignature.com-54494-287-7D6651836EFDDE231776C47139AEF3D02e3c5.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"64\"/></p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<center>(http://i.imgur.com/Z71giUDb.jpg)</center>\n\n\nI had recently got back from a 10 day trip from China and during the trip came across a number of amusing translation. These translations are humorous it translates Mandarin literally word by word  into English.\n\nJust like the wine tonic above which supposed to be good for the libido. I am not sure what magic will happen if you drink it. I can only speculate why it's production has to be supervised by a University, maybe it is to ensure that the magical quality is retained. Hopefully this tonic is not made from our private parts but made for the private parts.\n\n<center>(http://i.imgur.com/lyVEq6Eb.jpg)</center>\nThis is actually a sign found at the Baotou Airport, Inner Mongolia. It is placed to indicate where the basins are for washing hands.\n\n<center>(http://i.imgur.com/2vFgL3ob.jpg)</center>\nThis sign is placed at urinal at the same airport. It tells users to aim carefully while urinating.\n\nBut the crown in the jewel is the brochure from a hotel in China which I received through whatsapp\n\n> Getting There: \nOur representative will make you wait at the airport. The bus to the hotel runs along the lake shore. Soon you will feel pleasure in passing water. You will know that you are getting near the hotel, because you will go round the bend. The manager will await you in the entrance hall. He always tries to have intercourse with all new guests. \n\n<center>(http://www.freakingnews.com/pictures/76000/Outside-Hotel-Sacher--76234.jpg)</center>\n<center>[Image Source](http://www.freakingnews.com/pictures/76000/Outside-Hotel-Sacher--76234.jpg)</center>\n \n> The Hotel: \nThis is a family hotel, so children are very welcome. We of course are always pleased to accept adultery. Highly skilled nurses are available in the evenings to put down your children. Guests are invited to conjugate in the bar and expose themselves to others.   But please note that ladies are not allowed to have babies in the bar. We organize social games, so no guest is ever left alone to play with them self. \n \n<center>(http://i.huffpost.com/gen/863170/images/o-HOTEL-AMENITIES-FOR-KIDS-facebook.jpg)</center>\n<center>[Image Source](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/863170/images/o-HOTEL-AMENITIES-FOR-KIDS-facebook.jpg)</center>\n\n>The Restaurant: \nOur menus have been carefully chosen to be ordinary and unexciting. At dinner, our quartet will circulate from table to table, and fiddle with you. \n \n<center>(http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/6ab3f44f1fca4352a12f6c2ad90f7079/orkney-folk-festival-stromness-orkney-musicians-playing-fiddle-and-ac5k5c.jpg)</center>\n<center>[Image Source](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/6ab3f44f1fca4352a12f6c2ad90f7079/orkney-folk-festival-stromness-orkney-musicians-playing-fiddle-and-ac5k5c.jpg)</center>\n\n> Your Room: \nEvery room has excellent facilities for your private parts.   In winter, every room is on heat. Each room has a balcony offering views of outstanding obscenity!! You will not be disturbed by traffic noise, since the road between the hotel and the lake is used only by pederasts. \n \n<center>(http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIfttR6CW8A/VKOYof2_6II/AAAAAAAAAO8/5q7npupEKNA/s1600/hot_weird_funny_amazing_cool6_bed-jumping-fun-15_200907271835396642.jpg)</center>\n<center>[Image Source](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIfttR6CW8A/VKOYof2_6II/AAAAAAAAAO8/5q7npupEKNA/s1600/hot_weird_funny_amazing_cool6_bed-jumping-fun-15_200907271835396642.jpg)</center>\n\n> Bed: \nYour bed has been made in accordance with local tradition. If you have any other ideas please ring for the chambermaid. Please take advantage of her. She will be very pleased to squash your shirts, blouses and underwear.   If asked, she will also squeeze your trousers. \n\n<center>(https://silkysoulstar.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/maid.jpg)</center>\n<center>[Image Source](https://silkysoulstar.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/maid.jpg)</center>\n \n>Above All: \nWhen you leave us at the end of your holiday, you will have no hope. You will struggle to forget it.\n\nCheers\nCharles\n---\nIf you like my writing please up-vote, share, comment and [follow me](https://steemit.com/@positivesteem).",

We are commanders and chief of our online social personas. We can mould it to how we want the world to see us. Posting about successes and achievements to show how great life is. Of course we all do it, it feels good and comments of praise lift you up.\n\n## My online life looks great, I get to travel around to beautiful places, take photos, film and meet some cool people. What a life right? \n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8183/28915478513_3f1c2f185f_c.jpg\n\nBeautiful pictures, but if you delve deep into the story behind and after them it's not all sunshine. \n\n**Seeing people's photos every now and then can stir feelings of both inspiration and jealousy, making you question why your life is not as good.**\n\nThere's the countless hours involved in organising, emailing and working on a project. If it gets dropped your time and energy was mostly wasted. Bye bye motivation to get back on track for the next idea. With a finished project you have a lot of editing to do. Glaring in front of a computer screen for days on end. There is no 9 to 5 and no boss meaning you have only the feeling of guilt to answer to if something happens. \n\n## No matter what you do in life, there's always a trade off. Great co-workers vs being a lone-wolf, comfortable structured pay vs hustling for the next paid project, travelling all the time vs making real friendships,  the list goes on.\n\n\n# The Reality of Everyones Life\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8217/29424344472_f31b612248_c.jpg\n\n**Reaching a goal in life is a roller coaster of hurrahs and panic attacks.** The goal can be as small as going to the supermarket or writing a Steemit post. It will always be a roller coaster because of so many distractions and life emergencies. \n\n## I'm typing this post from a library, everyone has shit to do.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8206/29424348282_d29299fcab_c.jpg\n\nAs I type this post from a library from beautiful New Zealand people are hunched over books and laptops workings. Essays to write, documents to send off. We're all working on something. To those who are not working or being creative, then I'd hint that they're probably bored for a majority of their time, so life still sucks.\n\n## Everyone works, no matter how great their life visually seems they probably have a lot of work to do.\n\n\nThe trick to learn in life is to realise that you're not alone. Everyone's life sucks in some way or another no matter how you look at it. From the super poor to super rich there's always a problem either hidden or in plane sight. Being rich with no real friends, being really poor but apart by a great community, emotional health, anxiety, weary relationships. There's always something. \n\n\n\n## The grass always looks greener on the other side. But in reality we have different eyes and different perceptions of colour. \n\n## Everyone has to mow their own grass at some point.",

    "body": "In [Part 1](https://steemit.com/life/@mikehere/moving-to-paradise-from-creating-quickpay-for-quicken-to-living-on-a-sailboat-in-the-caribbean-part-1) I wrote how I went from creating QuickPay for Quicken to selling almost everything to go live on a sailboat in the Caribbean.  Now the adventure starts.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mikeboat-30.jpg\n\n<h1>We arrive in Sint Maarten</h1>\n\nWe flew in to the Sint Maarten Airport and promptly made our way to the [Simpson Bay Marina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Philipsburg,+Sint+Maarten/@18.0330789,-63.0898736,405m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c0e6e6fae6a1b5b:0x97717fec86e75342!8m2!3d18.0295873!4d-63.0471039).   There she was a beautiful Jeanneau 44 foot sailboat.  My heart was racing with excitement.\n\nWe go shopping for supplies and get our things on board for the 110 mile journey to [Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Isles](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Princess+Juliana+International+Airport+(SXM)/@18.4646195,-64.4203979,14151m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xbed22586b7168f3b!8m2!3d18.0418701!4d-63.1130809).  (Click on the links for a map of each area)\n\n<h2>Comedy of errors</h2>\n\nOur first task is to time the opening of the drawbridge so we can get the boat out of the bay and make our way to our first stop in [Anguilla](https://www.google.com/maps/@18.1985509,-63.0967922,2105m/data=!3m1!1e3).\n\nThe bridge only opens twice a day so we should make this first opening in about an hour.  So we fire up the engine and the boat broker throws our lines on deck and we are off!\n\nExcept I can't remember how to engage the transmission and we are about to hit the boat behind us and then I remember to pull out the little pin on the throttle handle and away we go.\n\nJust out of the dock I see a red buoy and think, ok red right return so let's go to the left of the buoy.  Except the French system is opposite and all the sudden the boat comes to a halt and we are stuck in a sandbar.  Oh, no!   How embarrassing!\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/zNrg4ulntLBMk.gif\n\nI put the boat in full reverse and it just won't budge.  But after about 30 minutes of trying it finally breaks lose and I go around the other side of the buoy and head for the drawbridge.  Just before we get there it starts to close.  We missed it!  So now we had to hang out for 8 hours in the bay and get the next opening at 5:30pm.\n\nWe finally make it out but then we have to stay the night outside the bay.  There are so many boats that I didn't put out enough line for the anchor and at about 2am I get a knock on the boat from someone on their boat saying we are getting too close.  Oh man, so now we bring the anchor back up and set it somewhere else with more line this time.  After that it was hard to get back to sleep.\n\n<h1>Day 2: We are on our way to Anguilla</h1>\n\nWe got up around 5am and headed off to [Anguilla](https://www.google.com/maps/@18.1985509,-63.0967922,2105m/data=!3m1!1e3) which is about 20 miles away to stay the night.  We had a great time sailing and had no problems the whole day.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/boatatsunset.jpg\n(Gorgeous sunsets)\n\n<h1>Day 3: Up the next morning and off to Virgin Gorda</h1>\n\nWe woke up around 3am to chart our 90 mile course with no other islands in between.  With our gps set we bring up the anchor and set the sails and away we go.\n\n<h2>About 40 miles out the wind dies</h2>\n\nEverything was great and we were seeing some amazing sword fish jumping.  I was thinking it would be awful to be skewered with one jumping over the boat. \n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/l2Jebcuu1yUiwuVlS.gif\n\nWe take down the sails and start motoring and I noticed the fuel gauge move to 1/4 tank.  That was so strange because it was on full when we left and we didn't use it that much.  (Turns out the gauge would read full when there is only 1/4 tank.  Oh no!)\n\nAfter motoring about 10 miles we needed the fuel so we put the sails back up.  Here it is getting dark and our GPS loses the signal.  I don't say anything and hope it comes back soon because there are no islands in sight.\n\n<h1>Finally we see the outline of the island in the moonlight</h2>\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/moonoverislands.jpg\n\nLuckily it was a full moon that night and we could just make out the outline of the island.  It was so dark though by this time and we had to make our way around the south side of the island because our dock is on the other side.\n\n<h2>We almost crashed on the rocks</h2>\n\nLooking at the charts and looking at what looks like an opening we make are way around.  My wife is at the bow and we are still sailing in.  Then she says she hears what sounds like jet engines and the depth meter goes off and we are in 13 feet of water and our boat draws nine.  Oh no those are waves crashing on the rocks and so we hurry to start the engine and bring the boat around and get away.  Wow!  That was close!\n\nAfter going south a little more we see a better opening and make our way around.  By this time we are exhausted and a little cranky.\n\nWe make it to the entrance to the docks but there is a narrow path cut out of the reef with flashing lights guiding the way.  Then all the sudden there are no more lights and so we decide to back on out and go anchor for the night.\n\nWhat a day!\n\n<h1>Day 4: Safe and sound</h1>\n\nMorning came quick and in the daylight we can see the path and motor on in to dock.  This is where we took the boat out of the water in [dry dock](https://www.google.com/maps/@18.4482714,-64.4376073,407m/data=!3m1!1e3) to paint the bottom and have cleaned up.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/scan055.jpg\n\nVirgin Gorda is a wonderful island with such nice people.  One of our favorite areas is [The Baths](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Baths/@18.4277755,-64.4453238,3260m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6855decfba3024ac!8m2!3d18.4299856!4d-64.4446421).  We would come back here many times.\n\nhttp://mikepotterhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P2190003.jpg\n\n<h1>Lessons learned</h1>\n* Check the weather and see if you are in hurricane season.  September/ October is not really the best times to be there.\n* Top off your fuel even if your gauge says full.\n* Make sure you know which side of the buoy you should go on.\n* When you anchor be sure you put out enough line/chain and test it.\n* If you have a drawbridge to go through give yourself plenty of time to get there.\n* Have a high beam light so you can see at a distance in the dark.\n\nOverall we had a great time even though we almost killed ourselves on the rocks we made it!\n\nI have so many wonderful stories to tell about the islands and the island life.  Next stop is the US Virgin Islands where we went through so many hurricanes.  Hurricane Marilyn was the worst one in 50 years!\n\nThat's next time if you like.\n\n<b>If you're interested in hearing more please Upvote and leave a comment.

    "body": "<h3>It's not a secret that mowing the lawn is the most useless, wasteful thing a suburban moron can do.</h3>\n\nhttps://aegir.tech/steemit/Mowing-Grass.jpg\n\nIt wastes time.\nIt wastes gas.\nIt wastes money.\n\nIt wastes water, it wastes fertilizer, it wastes sunlight. \nIt even wastes the effort the grass puts into growing. \n\nImagine if you were the grass. You grow, grow, and grow, and then some cruel monster goes and cuts you up.\nTerrible.\n\nStrangely enough, we still get to suffer in such a way sometimes. A lot of people choose to take the effort of watering their grass. Predictably, watering your grass makes it grow faster, and then you have to cut it more, because you want the grass that you watered to be short. Makes no sense to me. \n\nIt can only be a cultural tradition. An insane cultist ritual. \n\nSo stop it. Just stop it. Why are you carrying out such a bizarre, useless ritual? \nAny excuse your make to carry out this chore is absurd. You can't justify this sort of thing. \"Keeps the bugs down\" is the only half-way legitimate reason I can think of, yet even that is bizarre in modern times. We live in houses, you know.\n\nGrass isn't even native to where you live, is it? Not lawn grass, at least.\nWhy not allow natural plants to grow? Or just grow fruiting plants and useful herbs?\n\nhttps://aegir.tech/steemit/dandelion.JPG\n\nI just can't imagine why grass is so important to you.\n\nIn older times, lawns were owned by the rich. They'd have their lawn, and their sheep and their goats, and the animals would eat the grass. Jealous peasants tried to imitate them, and well, here you are. That's you. \n\nYou're the jealous peasant who has no idea why you have a useless lawn. \"Because it looks nice.\"\n\nNot a chance. Lawns are abnormal. Our animal instinct loves the wilderness. It hates lawns and suburban aesthetic. Our eyes crave beautiful flowers, wild shrubs, groups of trees, and little rocks and boulders, embedded in the naturally fertile earth.\n\nWhy not just install solar panels instead of grass, at least? Even if you hate flowers and herbs and trees, maybe you're the weird sort who wants endless fields of machines and lifeless concrete. Solar panels. Go for it. \n\nMowing the lawn raises dust and pollen; grass viscera and fumes enter your lungs, and then your nose starts to run. If it doesn't run, you're probably just letting the plant fragments rot in your lungs. Terrifying. Besides spreading pollen all over, and having all your neighbors be forced to inhale gasoline fumes and dead grass mist, you're also making a lot of noise.\n\nhttps://aegir.tech/steemit/evilmower2.jpg\n\nYes, lawn mowers are loud and irritating. They ruin the beautiful sounds of summer. The soothing sounds of wind, birds, leaves and bugs is all replaced by the most hideous sound I can imagine, perhaps even worse than the screech of scratching forks on plates. Why make me suffer? Why shatter the ambience of summer? It's disgusting and so wasteful, I really can't tolerate it.\n\nAnd worst of all, lawn mowers violently grind up tiny mice, toads, frogs, innocent spiders, baby rabbits, moles, and all sorts of little living beings. \n\nIncluding kittens, perhaps.\n\n\"Good riddance\", you say? Shame on you. You're a human, so you go live in your house all safe. The outside is for the wild animals, so respect them. Don't grind them into paste. That sort of thing is obscene and disturbing, and when it's all because of some unnecessary societal ritual, it simply cannot go on.\n\nSo like I said before: Stop. Just quit doing this whole \"suburban lawn\" thing, and rebel. Sure, some crazed city council might threaten to steal your money. Sure, your neighbors might start cursing you under their breath. But honestly, this is a cult that we need to abandon.\n\nLawns are seriously an eyesore to me.\n\n*~Kitten*",

    "body": "<a href=\"http://imgur.com/vo1pgYe\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vo1pgYe.jpg?1\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\nMany new authors don't know where to start when they publish a book, and it gets to the marketing stage. \n\nAccording to the book \"The Book Marketing Bible.\" \n-Only 20% of Self published authors make money, \n\nI wrote a few  other articles about this subject\n[How I Got My Kindle Books To Sell Like wildfire](https://steemit.com/life/@kaylinart/how-i-got-my-kindle-books-to-sell-like-crazy)\n[How To Stay Motivated to write](https://steemit.com/writing/@kaylinart/how-to-stay-motivated-to-write-steemit-exclusive)\n[How I Design My Book Covers On Gimp](https://steemit.com/life/@kaylinart/how-i-design-my-book-covers-on-gimp-steemit-exclusive-detailed-guide)\n\n\n## What Is going on here? ##\n\nIt's the lack of marketing!!\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/stO5Zex\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/stO5Zex.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nYou aren't going to publish a book, Then immediately become rich and famous. It doesn't happen. The Game Of Thrones Series didn't become popular until now; It was published 1996. \n\nBecause of the ease of self-publishing, You have a lot more competition then ever before! But at the same time, Many of us wouldn't even have the opportunity to publish a book. The decentralization of the publishing industry makes it possible. \n\n\n## Make Marketing about your customer ##\nI know I mentioned it in my other article, but it's truly important. Too many people make the marketing about themselves. \n\nWhat the hell are you trying to do?\n\nSell the book to yourself?\nNo, sell the book to them! What do they like/hate! Figure that out. Listen to their feedback. \n\n- People want to buy on their terms. They don't want to feel like they are being \"sold to.\" They like to have their control over their money.\n\n## Make a list of your book ##\nAll the themes and topic mentioned in your book, Add them to your list. Now share that information. Give people a chance to see what they can expect from your book.\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/7BeVTNr\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7BeVTNr.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n## Compose Tweets ##\nMake sure to # Hashtag, Different areas to market your book. Don't be like every other annoying author. Don't SELL THEM your book. Ask them a question. Make if fun! Then add a link to your book, Target people who are naturally attracted to your book. If you write a cook book, Don't market to people who eat out all the time. They may not want to change their current habits. \n\nI can't emphasize this enough, \"If you help enough people get what they want, you will get what you want. \" \n\n\n# Book Marketing Mistakes #\n- Often release books with loud, persistent announcements over social media. \nWe all have that one friend, Who tries to sell makeup, Body products. And they are literally like this annoying little fly.\n**They Never go away** \nDon't be that fly. Be polite, friendly, Let people know about your book, But don't be all annoying either. \n\n\n- Not blogging, Then blogging some more.\nHopefully, this won't be a mistake that people on Steemit make, I hope we are more motivated than that. But people like the consistency. If we don't provide consistent blog posts, You can scare people away. \n\n- Solve someone else's problem.\nToo many authors are focusing only on their problem. \n\"Not making enough money.\"\nFocus on what other problems people have and go with that. What can you do to provide value for another person?\n\n- Have fun while writing your book\nAdd personality, Add excitement. People can tell when you are dragging your feet in the dirt with your writing, and they won't appreciate it one bit. \n\n# Other ways to promote your book #\n- Blog posts\n- Infographics\n- Q & A's. \n- Podcasts,\n- Special reports\n- Videos\n\n# Try Book Bub #\nBook Bub is hard to get on. But authors like Steve Scott Have found a lot of value from getting on there.\nYes, it costs money, based on the topic of your book. But I've heard how worth it is. I have yet to get on Book Bub for my books, But sadly it's for Kindle books only, So I can't put my coloring book on there.\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/GPX01Zq\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GPX01Zq.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n# Go to Book Fairs #\nGo to book fairs and hand things out, You don't have to get a booth. You can even offer to split costs with someone. If possible try to provide something for free.\n\nDon't let yourself fall into the 20% who will never make money off their book. Get out their and promote your book, So you don't have to go without. \n\n*Thank you Pexels for the great photos*",

In China, going to concerts is considered an extravagence because the price of a ticket can be up to 7.5 times the price of a comparable ticket in the west. According to some statistics, one concert ticket costs an average of 17.24% of an individuals GDP. This compared to the US figure of 1.81%, Japan's 3.11% and UKs 2.87%, you can already see the difference in relative expenditure between these countries. For the Chinese, it's a considerable financial offset.\n\n\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u53bb\u542c\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\uff0c\u73b0\u573a\u7684\u6c14\u6c1b\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u97f3\u6548\u7ed9\u6211\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u4eab\u53d7\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5176\u5b9e\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u770b\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u5962\u4f88\u7684\u4eab\u53d7\u3002\u56fd\u5185\u4e00\u573a\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u7968\u4ef7\u5927\u6982\u662f\u6b27\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u76847.5\u500d\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u770b\u4e00\u573a\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u5360\u5230\u4eba\u5747GDP\u768417.24%\uff0c\u800c\u7f8e\u56fd\u662f1.81%\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u662f3.11%, \u82f1\u56fd\u662f2.87%\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u9ad8\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u95e8\u7968\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5962\u4f88\u54c1\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u6d88\u8d39\u538b\u529b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u3002\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DDvEtv3.jpg)\n\nOne of the differences worth mentioning between Chinese concerts and Western, is that in China, the area around the stage always has seats. This means even at the front, people are sitting down to watch the stage. However, western concerts often have seatless areas at the front that allow listeners to stand and dance. Concert goers can also hold their whiskys, singing and dancing along with the performers. When they feel extra excited, they often throw their drink cups to the sky in euphoria. In tandem, the singers often jump into the crowd and the fans can shuffle them along.\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u5728\u89c2\u770b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6b27\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5728\u56fd\u5185\uff0c\u821e\u53f0\u524d\u9762\u573a\u5730\u5185\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u662f\u6709\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u542c\u97f3\u4e50\u4f1a\uff0c\u800c\u56fd\u5916\u7684\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\uff0c\u821e\u53f0\u524d\u9762\u573a\u5730\u5185\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u901a\u5e38\u6ca1\u6709\u5ea7\u4f4d\uff0c\u89c2\u4f17\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3e\u7740whisky\u548c\u6b4c\u624b\u4e00\u8d77\u5531\u4e00\u8d77\u8df3\uff0c\u5174\u594b\u9ad8\u5174\u4e86\u5c31\u628a\u6ee1\u6ee1\u7684\u9152\u676f\u629b\u5411\u5929\u7a7a\uff0c\u4eab\u53d7\u6e7f\u900f\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u3002\u6b4c\u624b\u9ad8\u5174\u4e86\u5219\u5f80\u53f0\u4e0b\u89c2\u4f17\u8eab\u4e0a\u4e00\u8eba\uff0c\u4efb\u7531\u53f0\u4e0b\u89c2\u4f17\u6765\u4f20\u9012\u8eab\u4f53\u3002\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/BXO6ZbK.jpg)\n\nThis is me at Big Bang's concert. They are like ***K-POP*** ambassadors of Korea. Bigbang came into existence in the year 2006, bringing with them, excellent music foundations as well ingenuity in style and stage presence. They are very likeable public figures, as such, they have garnered a wide and far reaching fan-base that has been the staples of their decade long career. Their music is easily approachable and so the general public can identify with them easily. This is of course down to their strengths in being able to write and produce their own music. Bigbang is considered the most popular group to come from Korea in recent history, their influence has allowed them to monetize substantial amounts of money from their fans. Afterall, it is the fan's who pay for things like CD's, Concert tickets, Karaoke rights etc. This Bigbang phenomenon has continued to add fuel to Korea's highly competitive K-POP entertainment industry that produces new acts like products on a production line.\n\n\u8fd9\u573a\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u662f\u97e9\u56fd\u7ec4\u5408big  bang\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u97e9\u56fd\u5a31\u4e50\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u4eba\u7269\u3002Bigbang\u57282006\u5e74\u51fa\u9053\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u7a33\u56fa\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u7fa4\u52a0\u4e0a\u6210\u5458\u4eec\u7684\u4eb2\u6c11\u5f62\u8c61\u548c\u968f\u548c\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u7684\u79d8\u8bc0\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u975e\u5e38\u5e73\u6613\u8fd1\u4eba\uff0c\u88ab\u5927\u4f17\u719f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u5f3a\u7684\u539f\u521b\u80fd\u529b\u3002Bigbang\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u6210\u529f\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6487\u5f00\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u7c89\u4e1d\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff08\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u4ea7\u4e1a\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u8d21\u732e\u4ea7\u503c\u7684\u662f\u6b4c\u624b\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u7c89\u4e1d\u6240\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684CD\u3001\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u95e8\u7968\u3001\u6b4c\u66f2\u4e0b\u8f7d\u548cKTV\u4e2d\u70b9\u6b4c\u7248\u7a0e\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u6784\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u662f\u97e9\u56fd\u660e\u661f\u751f\u4ea7\u7ebf\u6839\u636e\u7c89\u4e1d\u5fc3\u7406\uff0c\u6253\u9020\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u201c\u4ea7\u54c1\u201d\u3002\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lHAVL7Q.jpg)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8o0EkuV2bM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nTickts for Bigbang's tour around China have been in high demand. Everybody knows how difficult it is to buy a house, and yet people have jokingly said, buying tickets to a BigBang concert is even harder than buying a house. Their tickets are usually sold out within minutes of going on sale. Due to the Korean Military system requiring all men to join the army for a few years, BigBang's members are due to be called up to Military service very soon, essentially disbanding the band temporarily till the year 2022. It's possible that when they finish their military service, they may embark on solo careers. This is why, Bigbang concerts are even more desirable, for fear that they may never perform together again. Some tickets have been resold at extremely high prices well into the thousands USD. Fake tickets have also become a severe problem too with many people being unaware when buying fake tickets.\n\n\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u5de1\u56de\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u4e00\u7968\u96be\u6c42\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u77e5\u9053\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e70\u623f\u5b50\u5f88\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4eba\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e70\u4ed6\u4eec\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u95e8\u7968\u6bd4\u4e70\u623f\u5b50\u8fd8\u96be\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u7968\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u88ab\u62a2\u7a7a\uff0c\u8fd8\u9020\u5c31\u4e8620\u4e07\u4eba\u62a2\u51e0\u5343\u5f20\u7968\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u706b\u7206\u5386\u53f2\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u6309\u7167\u97e9\u56fd\u7684\u4e49\u52a1\u670d\u5175\u5f79\u5236\u5ea6\uff0cbigbang\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5f88\u5feb\u8981\u5165\u4f0d\uff0c\u4e0b\u6b21\u5168\u5458\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6700\u5feb\u4e5f\u52302022\u5e74\uff0c\u51e0\u4f4d\u6210\u5458\u670d\u5b8c\u5175\u5f79\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5355\u98de\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6b21\u5de1\u6f14\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u4e0d\u60f3\u9519\u8fc7\u3002\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ec4\u725b\u515a\u5c06\u95e8\u7968\u5012\u5356\u5230\u51e0\u4e07\u5143\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u7684\u5929\u4ef7\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\u5047\u7968\u6765\u586b\u8865\u7c89\u4e1d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/SAFi0cv.jpg)\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/shGgthL.jpg)\n\nUpon arriving at my seat, I found a goodie bag prepared for each attendee that contained some light sticks and other items used to interact with BigBang on stage. These are all prepared to help boost morale and keep the interaction between BigBang and the fan's strong. \n\n\u5f53\u6211\u6765\u5230\u89c2\u4f17\u5e2d\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ea7\u4f4d\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u888b\u5b50\u4e3a\u89c2\u4f17\u7cbe\u5fc3\u51c6\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u548c\u6b4c\u624b\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u53eb\u505a\u5e94\u63f4\u7269\u3002\u5e94\u63f4\u662f\u6307\u5728\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u73b0\u573a\uff0c\u53f0\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u7528\u624b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u63f4\u8367\u5149\u68d2\u7ed9\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6b4c\u624b\u6253\u6c14\u52a0\u6cb9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\nThe Bigbang goodie bag is an example of Korea's attention to detail in bringing greater fan interaction and satisfaction. In the picture below, you can see the yellow crown light stick which was designed by G-Dragon. This defies the standard colours and designs used for glowsticks at other concerts. All BigBang fans are collectively called VIP. In the goodie bag, there are also some rings which glow different colour. The different colours are to be worn for different songs. Along with these rings, there is a booklet explaining which song matches which ring. My friends took some pictures of the stuff as you can see. The whole experience is heightened by these extra opportunities to interact with Bigbang. Of course, getting some goodies is also great as a souvenir.  Overall, the experience has new highs because of these goodies, and the concert feels more personal as it's geared around interaction with the fans. \n\n\u4ee5bigbang\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u97e9\u56fd\u5e94\u63f4\u6587\u5316\u8ba9\u6211\u5f88\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002bigbang\u7684\u5e94\u63f4\u7269\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u7cbe\u7ec6\uff0c\u4e0b\u56fe\u4e0a\u9ec4\u8272\u7684\u7687\u51a0\uff0c\u542c\u8bf4\u662fbigbang\u961f\u957fGD\u4eb2\u81ea\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5e94\u63f4\u8272\u6216\u4e00\u822c\u5e94\u63f4\u68d2\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u7687\u51a0\uff0c\u9884\u793a\u738b\u8005\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e0ebigbang\u7c89\u4e1d\u7684\u7edf\u79f0VIP\u76f8\u547c\u5e94\u3002\n\u5e94\u63f4\u5e03\u6761\u6302\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6905\u5b50\u80cc\u4e0a\u3002\u6211\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u6dd8\u6c14\u7684\u62ff\u8d77\u5b83\u7167\u76f8\u3002\n\u888b\u5b50\u91cc\u6709bigbang\u7684\u5e94\u63f4\u624b\u6307\u706f\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\uff0c\u53f0\u4e0b\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u968f\u65f6\u53d8\u6362\u624b\u6307\u706f\u7684\u989c\u8272\u548c\u6b4c\u624b\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\n\u888b\u5b50\u91cc\u9762\u8fd8\u7ec6\u5fc3\u7684\u653e\u4e86\u4e00\u5f20\u8bf4\u660e\u4e66\uff0c\u544a\u8bc9\u89c2\u4f17\u5728\u6f14\u5531\u54ea\u9996\u6b4c\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53d8\u6362\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u8367\u5149\u706f\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u89c4\u5b9a\u597d\u548c\u6b4c\u624b\u5408\u5531\u7684\u66f2\u76ee\uff0c\u5b89\u6392\u89c2\u4f17\u5728\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u914d\u5408\u6b4c\u66f2\u6240\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5e94\u63f4\u65b9\u6848\u8ba9\u7c89\u4e1d\u548c\u6b4c\u624b\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6781\u81f4\u3002\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9SzVVdw.jpg)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvigV1ALSL0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt's hard to believe that a member of the audience turned up wearing a Wedding Dress (this is the name of a very famous song of theirs)\n\n\u96be\u4ee5\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a\u89c2\u4f17\u662f\u7a7f\u7740\u5a5a\u7eb1\u5165\u573a\u770b\u6f14\u5531\u4f1a\u7684\u3002\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/bQW75K1.jpg)\n\nFans in the middle section also held up lights in the shape of 'BB' BigBangs abbreviation.

Cute animals to excite your happiness. \n\n# I'll explain my story after these photos.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8362/29020206292_2cfc3a0234_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8468/29125652205_08c6926690_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8783/29020209542_852769eb13_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8823/29020210052_1d70cb56a8_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8269/29020210402_e4e7cdfd65_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8051/29048587111_5cf8bd17bc_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8426/29125654135_64ba60cd76_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8561/29020361652_5ea4043667_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8428/29020211042_b4eebc03fb_b.jpg\n\n## Happy emotions come running into your head. \n\n## That's the aim of photography, to pull an emotional string to compel people. \n\nOf course, animals are a great subject matter. Especially if they're adorable. But I had stumbled on something different, un-tapped quokka knowledge. There was very little quokka content on the internet in 2013 and **unbeknownst to me, I opened up the flood gates.**\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8422/29048587251_54b064aced_b.jpg\n\n## Firstly, what in the world are these little animals?\n\nQuokkas are small little marsupials found on Rottnest Island in Western Australia. Unfortunately there are only around 12,000 left in the world meaning they're registered as vulnerable species.\n\nThink of them about the size of a cat, with the body structure of a kangaroo with the face of smiling bear. Crazy cool.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8858/28505299204_39831071f3_b.jpg\n\nBeing nocturnal, they love the night. It's the best time to come out and look for food. But you'll see them during the day chilling out under the shade of bushes, trees and shelters.\n\n## If your photography adds value and helps people you're on the right track.\n\nI took the photos for fun, uploaded some and the emails started rolling in. **What company could possibly want these photos? Well it turns out they are very valuable to Tourism Australia.** Showcasing an adorable animal exclusive to Australia could drive people to Australia. That's the tourism board's main job, get people to travel to Australia.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8174/29126191365_c6752e6dac_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8026/29127795355_e6ddf19d7b_b.jpg\n\n## The internet has your photos now, anything can happen\n\n\nThe images were featured by Tourism Australia and then reposted over countless Instagram accounts. Distractify and BoredPanda then featured my quokka selfies. People were over joyed to find out such an animal even existed. More and more people started sharing the photos across social. \n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8892/29093235376_610f2187ec_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8328/29093232536_cbf0e00a02_b.jpg\n\n\n## It was a tidal wave of likes and comments \n\nhttps://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7710/28509680373_0828049e2f_b.jpg\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8788/29023108382_27e7f4c8d8_b.jpg\n\nPeople were messaging me to say how much joy quokkas bring them. How it made their day and put a smile on their face. Now that's cool, **I'm very grateful to know that it  has brought joy to peoples lives.**\n\nAlthough it got to a point where I had to turn off push notifications.  \n\nI started uploading even more quokka photos to continue spreading smiles.\n\n## Buzzfeed interviewed me about my experience in Western Australia. \n\nOf course highlighting quokkas.\n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8519/28509252843_ec558a8c2d_b.jpg\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8503/28509257693_553fefec84_b.jpg\n\n## An Onboard Flight Magazine - JetStar \n\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8528/28509861553_456336d340_b.jpg\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8081/29051533371_1ef5764077_b.jpg\n\n## A welcoming billboard in Perth Airport\n\nThanks to Joey Kavanagh for spotting this one.\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8480/28506437904_72317a4f23_b.jpg\n\n## Even Japanese TV shows. \n\n##  I have no idea what they're saying.\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/l0MYJ1iStmLeIZROU.gif\n\nhttp://i.giphy.com/l0MYx48X6YBtyWkEg.gif\n\n\n## I was astonished at the effect which these photos where having on the world. \n\nPeople now associate me with quokkas. I have become this animal guy by uploading a few high quality images and the rest is history. The internet made the decision for me.  **It was obvious, I had to go back to hangout with the quokkas to capture even more content.**\n\n## To be continued...",

    "body": "<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lBuTTSQ.jpg)</center>\n## Remembering....\nEarlier today, @hanshotfirst posted an article, [Where Were You.... On September 11, 2001?](https://steemit.com/life/@hanshotfirst/where-were-you-when-a-perspective-from-inside-an-american-classroom-as-the-tragic-events-of-september-11-2001-unfolded#@streetstyle/re-hanshotfirst-where-were-you-when-a-perspective-from-inside-an-american-classroom-as-the-tragic-events-of-september-11-2001-unfolded-20160910t161030495z). It was a great post and it reminded me of that day, and of the great loss of life that occurred on that most infamous of dates. In commenting to his article, @hanshotfirst really made me feel better when he replied, _<br>\n\"I am thrilled you listed a happy memory here! That is how you hold onto somebody.\"_ <br>\nHis reply actually inspired me to introduce you to my great friend, [Christian Regenhard](http://www.christianregenhard.com/), a most humble yet amazing and heroic young man.\n## Semper Fidelis\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/aIRgZgV.jpg)</center>\nI don't remember the exact date or year for that matter, but it must have been sometime around 1993 or 1994 when my friend Jesse returned from a U.S. Marine's Tour in Mogadishu, Somalia. The chunky happy go lucky Jesse that had left for the marines, was replaced by a skinny, bald headed, wide-eyed, nervous and jumpy chain-smoking U.S. Marine. Somalia had been bad, and Jesse had been in the middle of it. But now he was home, and we would let the good times roll again, just like before he left for the U.S. Marines.\n\nIt was during Jesse's weekend leave that a lot of the homesick Marines would come to LA to Jesse's house. That is where I met Steve, they called him 'Meat' due a large head, from Texas. I also met Dave K, Eric V. and Christian, all New Yorkers. My first encounter with true New Yorkers, and boy did Dave and Eric talk fast with a lot of animation. Christian on the other hand was more subtle and reserved, yet just as genuine as the others. I just mentioned a few, but all the Marines that we met through Jesse where all simply phenomenal human beings. Those times were some of my most fondest memories of my young adulthood.\n## Filled with Laughter\nIt was during these times, that Jesse, Dave, Eric, Christian, my brother Eric and myself went on an adventure to Park City, Utah. I had some friends that lived there and were ski instructors for the winter. They had invited us, and we took them up on the offer. The fellas took a week of leave and off we went in my 1990 Grey Jeep Cherokee. We laughed all the way there and we laughed all the way back. \n\nOn the way there, we let Dave K. drive as soon as we crossed into Utah in the middle of the night. Dave, being a New Yorker did not have a license when he arrived to California and Camp Pendelton. On this trip, he had just acquired his driving permit, and asked if he could drive. So literally, upon entering Utah, we pulled over and let him drive. Of course it was not 5 minutes before we were pulled over by a Utah State Trooper. He pulled us all out of the vehicle while it was below zero, checked our vehicle for like an hour while we froze, then let us back on our way. He didn't find what he was looking for since we had probably already smoked it all. Ha!\n\nPark City was beautiful of course, and the skiing was spectacular. The New Yorkers were used to the snow, but us Angelenos were just totally out of our element. It was fun nonetheless, and the Park City nightlife was the best in Utah. Utah, being a mormon state, can be downright boring for most city slickers. One of our friends in Utah is an extra special \"Green Thumb\" and he made sure that we had plenty of \"green\" for our trip back home. \n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/JPD3b1q.jpg)<br>Postcards that I still have from that Trip</center>\n\nOur trip back home took us through a different, albeit more dangerous, road. On the way to Park City we took a major Highway; State Highway 189. On the way home, we took Route 190, which is smaller with sharper turns and runs next to a river. And yet we laughed through it all. At one point, our defrost stopped working, so our windows iced up and we could not see anything. We laughed when other vehicles would point at us, and we laughed when the curves were dangerous. It was snowing on the way home but we laughed anyway. And we would especially laugh because Christian would laugh and laugh, but NO SOUND of Laughter would come out....until he laughed so much he ran out of breath, at which point he would let out a sigh, \"phhhhheeeeeewwwwww\" when he could laugh no more, which would send the rest of us into uncontrollable laughter. Then Chris would laugh because we were laughing, with NO SOUND again, sigh at the end, \"pppphhheeeeewwwww,\" and the cycle of laughter would begin again. It continued until we arrived back home in California safe and sound with stronger Ab muscles from all the laughter.\n## The Wagoneer Caper\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/UMgWleq.jpg)<br>Christian bought one very similar in color and year to this one</center>\nThen time moved on, Jesse finished his tour as did the rest of the fellows. Christian though, he re-inlisted seeking further adventure as a Marine Recon. Jesse started working and got himself a girl. Eric and Dave remained in California for a bit. Finally Christian finished his Marine tour and decided that he wanted to join the New York Fire Department. At that the time, the city Fire Department was not hiring. Christian then decided that he would go to South America in the meantime, and teach people how to  Climb Ice Mountains. This would not be Christian's first time in South America. He and Dave K, actually travelled most of the Pacific Coast of South America after high school. Adventures were nothing new to these two especially Christian.\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/euP16cs.jpg)</center>\n\nFinally Christian got the call that the the New York City Fire Department would be hiring, and the Academy would be starting soon. So back to America he came. He came to Los Angeles with the intent of purchasing a car, to then drive back to Colorado to pick up a friend, and then on to New York and the Fire Academy. \nHe had his mind set on a Jeep Grand Wagoneer. (I often wonder if the trip to Utah influenced his decision, since we did travel in a Jeep Grand Cherokee that time.) So prior to his arrival, we had looked up some potential buys for him, and when he arrived we had a list to go through. And even this led to another fit of laughter. \n\nAfter going through the list of vehicles, we had found one that had potential. The owner of the Jeep had left the keys in the vehicle, but he had parked his new White BMW slightly behind and to the left of the Jeep, as some sort of deterrent I guess. Christian had spoken to the owner by phone, and the guy had said he would leave the keys while he was at work. But Chris needed to test drive the vehicle, and since there was some room, Christian pulled out the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, along with some of the BMW's white paint. LAUGHTER AND MORE LAUGHTER. \n\nLuckily, the damage was slight, and we had a friend that was a supervisor at a nearby auto body shop on the Westside of LA. We called him up and he said that BMW's is all he deals with, so he had the factory white paint to match. We touched up the BMW, let the paint dry and then buffed it out. A couple of hours later the guy showed up, Christian gave him the money, Christian jumped into the Jeep and we drove off laughing at our successful adventure.\n## Good Bye\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/RSO3Nzj.jpg)<br> Pic. of Christian at his Academy Graduation taken from a booklet about Christian's life that Jesse brought back from New York</center><center>\nSo now Christian had his Jeep Grand Wagoneer, and was ready for his road trip. We took the vehicle to my house and there gave it an oil change and tune up. We checked out the belts and fluids. We had to do some small minor repairs, then checked the vehicle one more time for road worthiness. It was ready. Christian was ready to go fulfill his life long dream of being a New York City Fire Fighter. We waved our good byes, and it would be the last time I would ever see my friend again.\n## Where was I?\nI was home, awakened by my mother early in the morning. She said that something really bad was happening and that she was scared and wanted me to see the news. I awoke to a television screen showing one tower with smoke bellowing out of the side, the News headline saying something like \" Commercial plane strikes World Trade Center.\" \nAs I watched that scene unfold, I had this strange sense that this would be getting a lot worse. As the 2nd plane crashed into the 2nd tower, I was dumbfounded. I knew this was not normal, and now this was clearly not an accident. This was in my mind, completely deliberate and purposeful. I felt that someone was out to hurt this country, the people of this country and ultimately me and my family. Even though this was transpiring some 3000 miles away, the fear that now gripped me was completely immobilizing. My sense of self preservation was kicking into overdrive, and I was just in my living room. As I watched the news telecast, I then began to wonder about New York, and what they were going through, and then it hit me; My friend Christian had just recently graduated from the New York Fire Academy in late July. Now as I watched the two towers burning, and heard the news about the other planes, I was in a zoned out state. The silent tears that flowed down my face came as the realization sunk in that my friend would be responding to this event. I knew then and there that I would never see my friend again; and then towers fell.\n<center>![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mYJNFqB.jpg)<br>Postcards and booklet that Jesse brought back after the funeral in New York</center>\n## Red Hook's Ladder 131\n**Christian Michael Otto Regenhard:**\nson of Al and Sally Regenhard\nbrother,\nfriend,\nU.S. Marine,\nNew York City Fire Fighter Red Hook's Ladder 131,\npoet, \nartist,\nwriter, \nhumble warrior,\ntriumphant athlete\ngreat adventurer,\nversed traveler ,\n**Heroic Human Being**\n08/25/1973 - 09/11/2001\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n<center>09/11/16<br>Full $teem Ahead!<br>@streetstyle<br>**My Top Blogs**<br>-[This Guy Caught Fire](https://steemit.com/life/@streetstyle/it-was-so-hot-this-guy-caught-fire-people-never-cease-to-amaze)<br>- [Coinbase Eggs](https://steemit.com/life/@streetstyle/why-i-pulled-my-bitcoin-out-of-coinbase-don-t-put-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket)</center>\nsources:\npixabay.com\nwikimedia.org\ngoogle.com\nwikipedia.org\nwww.christianregenhard.com",

    "body": "This is my testimony and maybe it could help you in some way so please pay attention to what I have to tell you...\n\n## I was in darkness for more than a decade and at the time I didn\u00b4t know that this darkness would become the source of my inner light.\n\nI was walking in the streets practically naked, half a sleep due to the effect of hard drugs. I was in the border of dementia, tried to kill myself and had so many bad experiences that I could practically write a book. But I am a warrior, a survivor, I lived to tell the story and hopefully become an example for those in need. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.imgsafe.org/90bd0cf65f.jpg)\n\nIt all started with the \u201cboom\u201d of electronic parties, we called them raves. The only drug I tried at the time was marihuana but in those parties a wide range of substances became part of my day to day. \n\nMy life was a mixture of happiness, sadness, euphoria, rage and depression. Coliraver was my nickname in the rave parties where I was widely known by most people, a kind of fame that I am not proud of. I still use the nickname on social networks to remind myself who I was, who I am. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://scontent.feoh1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/1913584_1269215166119_3134456_n.jpg?oh=2150a1ceb9a5cd4a5e82c82523048a2b&oe=585A183C)\n\nI was asleep for large parts of my darkness, but some life events helped me found my inner light. I learnt to love myself and I realized that I was getting older and I missed so many opportunities that were not going to come back, opportunities are unique and only come by once so you either take them or let them pass and I was missing all of them.  \n\nI decided to quit my bad habits and replace them with some healthy ones. I started hiking, which taught me a lot about self-improvement, there is no impossible goal if you have a good plan and the right motivation. Every time I am going up a mountain I think of everything I have been trough and I use it as motivation to keep going. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://scontent.feoh1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/1480634_10204748174641151_7492048129628838955_n.jpg?oh=2084f4583cf95d3d26919b8e00657ad2&oe=5816E1D1)\n\nI defined and wrote my short, middle and long term goals. Everything was more complicated once I decided to change, a lot of doors were already closed and there were lots of obstacles in the way. I was older but that didn\u2019t stop me.\n\nOne of the goals I was set to accomplish was graduating from university. Many times I thought of desisting and going back to my comfort zone: my old life, but I thought of the obstacles as hurdles that were there so I could prove to myself that I could do it, that I was worth something. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://scontent.feoh1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/293579_4849223664662_486003915_n.jpg?oh=a7fbdef92da6c06ac7a1a9d788fceac0&oe=58467E4E)\n\nLittle by little I was reaching the goals I set to achieve. I graduated from Business school and I found a job on an insurance company, where I learnt a lot and got promoted for my efforts. At the same time I was taking courses to become a mountain guide.  I created a group called \u201cAventuras sin frenos\u201d (adventure with no breaks) and became the leader of this hiking crowd, we organized trips to different mountains in Venezuela. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://scontent.feoh1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10410716_10152759222935458_2053470769415621614_n.jpg?oh=7ca5326918578dfb44e6fb634b6bfda4&oe=5846DFE4)\n\nI also developed a passion for photography, something that I wish to study and practice on my trips. My old life is now reduced to stories from my past, nothing more. \n\nI can now say I am a happy and proud man; I know where I am heading, with determination I can overcome any adversity. \n\n![](https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://scontent.feoh1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10885027_10205418686923539_7105740707960618049_n.jpg?oh=a0f7794208c1261b22af609369421a30&oe=585E883A)\n\n______\n\nThis post was published with the consent of the original author @coliraver\n[Spanish Version](https://steemit.com/spanish/@coliraver/de-la-oscuridad-a-la-luz-mi-testimonio-real-superacion)\n#unheardvoices",

If the answer is yes, then I don't feel sorry for you.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s17.postimg.org/z3joiaqr3/Screenshot_3.png\" width=\"632\" height=\"426\"/></p>\n<p><em>Me in Paris - not complaining about anything.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>I had a job that wasn't good for me. I quit that job even though I didn't have a new job. With a mortgage, car and other expenses it was a risky move. But two days before my last day in that first job, I got a new job. A job that has turned out to be one of the best jobs I ever had. Things will always work out, not necessarily the way you had planned, but it will work out. The worst thing that could happen was not getting a new job. In that case I'd have to rent out my apartment and stay at my parent for a month or two.<br>\nThat would still be better than staying in that job, and complaining about the job to my friends.</p>\n<p>Too many people complain about a partner that is this way or that way. Well, have you ever considered that it's possible to leave your partner? Being single is actually A-OK!</p>\n<p><strong>If you argue every day with your partner - leave.<br>\nIf you feel like life is predictable and boring - travel.<br>\nIf you have a lot of drama in your life - get some new friends.<br>\nYour boss is an asshole? - quit!</strong></p>\n<p><br>\nIt's all very easy.<br>\nDon't complain if the issue is something you can change.<br>\nLess talking, more doing.<br>\nJust do it.<br>\nAnd all other cliche sayings like carpe diem and seize the moment.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to think about what you can do to improve your life quality and to take one step towards kicking your problem(s) out the door.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Susanne</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Yesterday I had a job interview in the city of <strong>Lincoln, UK</strong>. A veterinarian practice was looking for a Vet to introduce in a poultry specialist group. Those who are following my blog should know that I am not working since 1 month because I need to finish my post degree and I need to be focused on my study.</p>\n<p><strong>I have never worked as a vet in poultry farms;</strong> I did some <em>Salmonella </em>inspections but be a specialised poultry veterinarian is something that I have never considered.</p>\n<p>Anyway few days ago I received this call where a woman was asking me if I was available for an interview and I said yes of course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two days ago I was reading a booklet I had from the previous job (just to refresh my knowledge before the interview).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_094909d4f68.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><strong>This is me and the booklet, ready for the interview :)</strong></p>\n<p>Lucky me, my girlfriend had a day off so we went together and my idea was... <em>\"let's do the interview.. and if I will not have luck, doesn't matter, I can see one of the nicest city in England\".</em></p>\n<p>I drove 120 miles and in 2.15 hours to be there!</p>\n<p>During the interview I wasn't stressed at all, I was laughing and making stupid jokes. One of the vets was coming from <strong>Cornwall</strong> and as you know I have been <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@webdeals/taking-steemit-to-the-end-of-the-land-land-s-end-cornwall-england-part-1\">there</a> 2 weeks ago, so I have something to talk about it :).</p>\n<p>The interview went very well ( I suppose ) and they told me that they will let me know by the end of the next week because they have other interviews and I said of course with a <strong>big smile</strong> on my face.</p>\n<p>At that point I didn't care about it... I had my chat/interview and now we were starving so, we drove directly to the city centre and we stopped in a restaurant called Zizzi, a chain restaurant where are serving Italian's food.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We had fritto misto ( mixed fried ) as starter, I had a massive pizza pepperoni and Kamila had pasta with I don't know what. We were starving so the only photo I have is about the starters LOL.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_142933c396c.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>We stand up after the meal like we were pregnant! </strong>So full that you cannot understand. We started looking around this city because in case I will get the job I should move there! Lincoln is a very nice city, medieval architecture, built on a hill with Cathedral and Castle on the top and all the buildings were going down till the marina that actually is an enlarged part of a river where you can find few boats.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164620ea5e5.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_164615f653e.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1521455a385.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1523034e72d.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1530325adda.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1545139d2ca.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We went in the main street that was plenty of shops, we started watching the first, the second etc etc... till finally we arrived in front of a street where the slope was at least 45%. Was the only way to get to the castle so I we went there and once arrived my heart was tachycardic. In that moment there was a graduation day, all the students from Lincoln's University were coming out from the Cathedral that was closed to the visitors and were going into the Castle. Well we were well dressed because the interview so we followed these students and relatives so we went in the castle and <strong>we didn't pay</strong> any ticket LOL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_1600271b2ee.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160052e1431.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/09/20160908_160542cf3b0.jpg\" width=\"5312\" height=\"2988\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After that and after the long day we agreed to come back home completely tired looking forward to rest a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: once I was typing this post I have received a voice mail from the vet that would like to discuss about my &nbsp;interview but I tried to call him back and he is busy. Keep tuned and I will let you know ;).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> THEY JUST CALLED ME TELLING THAT ARE GLAD TO OFFER ME THE POSITION AND THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ASAP IF I WILL BE PART OF THEIR TEAM</p>\n<h2>If you enjoyed my post feel free to follow me and to write me a comment. :)</h2>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My 2016 has been a series of intense and emotionally painful scenarios. Maybe I'll explain this further in a future article, but for right now, the gist of the story is that I fell into a massive depression between the months of March and August. It was Rock Bottom for me, and there were points during these months where I truly felt I was not going to make it out alive.  I began to close down emotionally, and completely isolated myself. Even my *best friend* did not hear from me for over five months. \n\nThe good news is that I don't feel like that anymore. As much as I truly wanted to lay down and give up, I somehow pushed through. I eventually realized that I was not living up to my full potential, and the situation I was in was <b>NEVER</b> going to let me live up to that potential. So I made drastic changes. I found some strength I unknowingly had, and <b>purged</b> the things in my life that didn't serve my greatest good. I basically chose to burn everything I knew down to the ground (metaphorically speaking) so I could build it up again; only better. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14199692_10154425280802180_5749426944932582371_n.jpg?oh=9562a7c5a6d1c91aa15b215bb06b89ac&oe=583A9C22\"></center>\n\nCurrently everything is still in shambles, though, at least the fire is out. And once you realize you've burned everything down, you quickly become motivated to fix that. Rock bottom is a good place to be at times. I believe everyone will go through some sort of Rock Bottom at some point of their life as a test of strength and character. \n\n<center><h5>Just *how* strong are you? Are you going to wallow, or are you going to push through it? It's completely up to you. Personally, I chose to wallow for about two weeks, and then I got sick and tired of that, graciously picked myself up, and moved forward.</h5></center>\n\nWhy did I metaphorically burn everything to the ground? Why did I give up the life I was living? \n\nBecause the metaphoric foundation of this metaphoric house was built on metaphoric sand. It really offered nothing for me except the promise of working hard for someone else's dream (a great dream, but not my dream), and living in someone else's shadow for the rest of my life. And I was ok with that at first, because I didn't really see myself as worthy or deserving of anything more. \n\n<center><h3>And then I experienced Ayahuasca.</h3></center>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14141936_10154397735912180_6968112830431779711_n.jpg?oh=69513099f9a5b8c992037d17ba3b5a4b&oe=587FCB23\"></center> \n\nI am so grateful that I got to meet this mind-blowing medicine. I sat wrapped in a blanket overlooking the Ocean in Acapulco, Mexico fascinated with the fact that I had a body! I truly feel like I touched the core of my soul in a time span of seven hours. And once you touch the core of your soul, you recognize *just how beautiful and loving* (and <b>powerful</b> because of that) you truly are. I realized the light inside of me that burned so passionately was not supposed to be wasted.\n\nI understood this medicine more than I understood myself, and in that moment I realized just how important it was to share Ayahuasca with as many people as I could. I realized that I had a powerful voice, and if I talked loud enough, people would hear me. I <b>knew</b> in that ceremony that I was put on this earth to help assist in the healing of others' mental and emotional states. Am I the healer? No. The real healer is the sacred plant. I'd just help administer her. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14233192_10154425322662180_7883334594280044695_n.jpg?oh=db3576234335e20913df775a5aadb296&oe=5845C4A4\"></center>\n\n<center><h3>*So the reason why I burned everything I knew, the reason why my life is literally unrecognizable, is to help in the process of healing our world; one individual at a time.*</h3></center> \n\nI truly believe that the Universe is evolving. We cannot push it faster than it is already moving. Obviously, the *Number 1* goal for anarchists is to end government. But I truly believe that will only happen when nearly everyone on earth has found inner peace. Without inner peace, there will be more tyranny, more war, more suffering. \n\n<center><img src=\"https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p206x206/14291778_10154425312337180_5341636245782905790_n.jpg?oh=e6cc3c75705b19747f4e793aefc7f001&oe=587E3796\"></center>\n\nThat's why I believe psychedelics are keys to our mind's eternal library. All psychedelics can open various doors into your subconscious, but I feel Ayahuasca is the <b>*Master Key*</b>. She can open the deepest hidden doors to your psyche in a very gentle way. \n\n<center><h4>I want to see a world full of love, personal freedom, and potential. I burned everything down so I could devote my entire life to helping others find their true potential through the therapy of Ayahuasca. She shows you how beautiful it is to be human, and that this experience should not be wasted. If my life has to be in shambles for a temporary period so more people find their true potential and inner peace, *I'm totally okay with that*.</center></h4>\n<br>",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>The time children spend in day care is associated with negative effects in social development. More hours in day care during a child\u2019s early years is associated with less social competence and cooperation, more problem behaviors, negative mood, aggression, and conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Negative effects of day care on social\u2013emotional development persist throughout early childhood and adolescence. Day care is linked with poorer average outcomes when children spend more time in center care, enter day care at an earlier age, or are in lower-quality care.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, in some parts of the country, putting a child through daycare can cost more than sending them to college. The annual childcare fees amount to $15,000 in some states. That means it could be cheaper to enroll your 4-year-old in a four year public college than daycare.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/Paying-for-Child-Care-WP4b2f5.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>When you start to weigh the long term benefits against a weekly paycheck, sometimes staying at home to take care of your kids makes sense.</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Is the short term expense of daycare reason enough for parents to quit their job?</em><strong> </strong>There are plenty of reasons why it is not a great idea to take a break from the workforce \u2013</p>\n<p>* Direct income loss: By taking a break of 5 years, what is the amount lost by not saving for retirement in 401k for those years? How much is the income loss in those 5 years? What is the cost of compounding all this income loss for 30 years until retirement at 7 percent return?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>* Promotions and income loss from that: Taking a 5 year break will most certainly be a career stalling act. Where would you be in the corporate ladder if you had worked through those 5 years? How much would your salary have increased due to promotions, bonuses and pay raises?</p>\n<p>* Other intangible losses: By staying at home you not only lose money, but skills stagnate, seniority is lost and connections fall away. What about any other opportunity costs?</p>\n<p>* Personality clash: Staying at home to care for kids is not for everyone. Some parents are much better parents because they work outside home. &nbsp;They are much happier with having workplace interactions, professional challenges and generally love their career.</p>\n<p>Stepping away from the workforce to care for your kids will save money in the short term, but is that best for your family in the long run?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>https://steemimg.com/images/2016/09/13/untitled52d02.jpg</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Options&nbsp;to possibly help cost and career</strong></p>\n<p>Childcare is expensive, but quitting your job is equally or even more expensive, especially if you are a career-minded person. You can explore several other avenues to reduce the cost of childcare:</p>\n<p>* If you have family who can provide free or low cost childcare, that might work for a part-time solution.</p>\n<p>* Can you team up with other parents and share a nanny?</p>\n<p>* Do you have a YMCA (or something similar) that provides childcare on a sliding cost basis? If you are in the low income bracket, you might pay next to nothing for someone to care for your child.</p>\n<p>* Try a co-op daycare. These are typically church or community groups where you have to volunteer for one day a week to get childcare for one week (other parents do the same).</p>\n<p>* Can you manage your shifts with your partner so that one partner works during the day, the other at night?</p>\n<p>* Can you work from home and hire a mother\u2019s helper?</p>\n<p>* If you work part-time, can you trade care with another mom working part-time?</p>\n<p>A lot of families choose to have one parent stay at home to raise the kids until they go to school not for financial reasons but because they believe that is what is best for their families. This post is not about whether one should stay at home or work; rather this post is to help people who are on the fence about going back to work purely for financial reasons. In that case, look at the big picture, not just the first few years but a few decades down the line and plan ahead.</p>\n</html>",

Everyone deserves to have the facts support them, whenever the facts can support them. Even the worst piece of shit deserves fairness, justice, and yes, even compassion.\n\nI know this - I have to believe this, because I've been that piece of shit - and if you're honest with yourself, you probably have been too. There were times in your life when people said that you didn't deserve anything - not compassion, not truth - or even moments when you said it about yourself. I have to believe that a piece of shit is worth something, because I have seen so many beautiful things grow out of shit. \n\nI have defended, or at least attempted to defend, the rights of so many, when I couldn't see anybody else who would, and people have called me all kinds of names, accused me of being a child molester, or telling me to kill myself. I don't hide from that degree of scorn - in fact, I welcome it. If that is the price of standing up for my fellow man, for defending the downtrodden, for lifting my brother from the mud, then I will pay it, a thousand times over. I will never stop paying it.\n\n# Compassion\nI would be nothing in this world if not for the compassion of those who owed me nothing. Perhaps if you think carefully about your own experience on Earth, you can remember a few times that make you feel gratitude.\n\nWhy did all those people help us, when they had nothing to gain but a smile? There is something inside which makes them want to step out of their way to do good, to make foreigners feel at home, to offer hospitality to a stranger. If you think about those moments, could you ever say that what they did was wrong, that they shouldn't have done it? If you consider it, and analyse it from any number of perspectives, I think you'll find the same conclusion as I did - that these are the best parts of humanity.\n\n# The humble prison guard\nThere is a guard in a prison, escorting a prisoner, who was guilty of a heinous crime. Maybe he has every reason to treat the prisoner like shit, to hate him, beat him, subject him to torture, but he doesn't. He treats the prisoner with respect, because he knows he is ignorant of that man's journey, he can never say for sure that that man was guilty of the crime of which he was convicted, he knows intuitively that torture will instill animosity and make his job harder, and he knows that this man, being a prisoner is already receiving his punishment. Justice is being executed, and he feels no responsibility to unilaterally give a harsher punishment. \n\n# Fear itself\nWe have more to fear from fear than from love. Fearing too much, hating too much, showing people scorn, denying people the opportunity to speak, or to breathe - once you do these things, you never get to take them back. The presumption of innocence can always be overturned with later evidence, and people's liberties can always be restricted later. And yes, even if people take advantage of you, you can always replace what has been lost.\n\nIf I am to make a mistake, let it be of loving too much, caring too much, trusting too much. It's easy to run out of friends for being fearful, hateful, paranoid, angry, bitter, spiteful or selfish. For those who love too much, though they might be taken advantage of frequently, even constantly, they rarely need worry about food, shelter, nor money, nor even that their soul be nourished. The soul nourishes itself.\n\n---\n\n# About me\n\n[![kurt robinson in the mountains of puebla](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/26/pictureofmecroppedbdb8d.md.jpg)](https://www.steemimg.com/image/gsqzK)\n\nMy name is Kurt Robinson.

    "body": "![](https://i.imgur.com/TxdFMNa.png)\n\nI has been living in Moscow about 5 years. I live in a midsized apartment in the center of Moscow with a view on a thoroughfare. Life around me is just bustling: people are hurrying up somewhere; the all kinds of sounds drown out each other. There are a lot of cars a wide variety of brands. Yes, Moscow never sleeps. The sights and masterpieces of architecture in Moscow are breathtaking too: Kremlin, Red Square, Tretyakov Gallery, Armouries, St. Basil\u2019s Church and so on. I\u2019m a beginner developer. I hope that Moscow will help me to achieve my goals and I believe in my success. Anyway, I\u2019m happy right now. \n\nAtmosphere\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a9AGU4f.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/czysqK6.jpg)\n\n\nMoscow is a great huge city full of life the whole day and whole night. There\u2019re many sufficient people, many huge main offices of well-known companies, new different buildings and skyscrapers. All these are just incredible. However, there\u2019s too much vanity in Moscow because it\u2019s a huge city. You feel yourself alone in this megapolis. Grey sky, people who always hurry up somewhere, road traffics and many factors like these makes the atmosphere in Moscow grey, lonely and too vanity in some of your days. Not everyone will be able to live in this city. \n\nPeople\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nCNR7Mo.png)\n\nI know one interesting fact about people from Moscow. Many people came here because they has wanted to make a career or to get married. Thus, people on the streets always hurry up on their business. It\u2019s a rare fact when someone decide to stop and show you the right road with a smile on his face like in New-York, for example. People rather meet each over in the places like metro, park, bus stop or even cinema. Moscow is a lonely place, there\u2019s no rally crowd in this city, However, if you find friends or just good acquaintances between your colleagues or something like that they will be you really good friends at this \u00abOn one\u2019s Jack\u00bb city. \n\nOpportunities\n===\n----\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VDSJoSc.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F1Agbxb.png)\n\n\nMany people come to Moscow because they believe they can realize their dreams in this place. Well, many of them really get successful after some time. Some of them are not get successful and they are often unhappy. Anyway, that\u2019s true that there\u2019re a lot of different opportunities in Moscow. You just should already have some experience to be further than others. Maybe Moscow so fast and crowded because of this fact. \n\n<em>@kental with you!\n\n\n<em><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@kental\">Follow me!!!!</a> </em>",
