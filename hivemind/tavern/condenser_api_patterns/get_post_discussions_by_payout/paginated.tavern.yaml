  test_name: Hivemind condenser_api.get_post_discussions_by_payout patterns test

  marks:
    - patterntest # unlike in old version where page defining post (last from previous page) was always part of new page (along with others with the same
                  # payout, potentially making it impossible to move forward with pages), new version always skips it, also has defined order for posts with
                  # the same payout (previously random)
