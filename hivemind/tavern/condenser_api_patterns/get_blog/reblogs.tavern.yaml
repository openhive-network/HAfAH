  marks:
    - patterntest # old didn't correct limit when it was too big, also there was less reblogs due to some bug (.orig prepared with max valid limit 4)
                  # finally time of reblog was incorrectly taken from post, now it is time when reblog happened

  # Communities not implemented under 5 mln blocks, but some were created by mock mechanism.
  # For these communities for account `test-safari` were created 4 artificial comments. Permlinks: `secrets1`, `secrets2`, `secrets4`, `secrets5`
