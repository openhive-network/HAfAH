Many people don\u2019t like competition, some people fear it, some people get motivated by it, and some people see it as an opportunity that helps them step up to the next level.\n\nPersonally, I get the same emotional reflex from new competition than I get from any change of weather, it doesn\u2019t really faze me that much.  Long time ago I\u2019ve learned to open a new folder in my brain containing all the elements that I can\u2019t control, and the emergence of new competition certainly qualifies for that folder.\n\nAnd the reason I do that is because I think that the worst thing you possibly can do is to let your fear-based reactions make your decisions for you.\n\nAlthough to be totally honest with you, I\u2019d be an idiot if I told you to completely ignore competition and act as if doesn\u2019t don\u2019t exist. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s well worth your attention because it may show you something you\u2019ve missed, it may remind of why you do what you do in the first place, and depending on the competition, it can even help you improve and advance. \n\n![Alt Text](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCsWg5lEM9w/To2MZ4wwQMI/AAAAAAAAI8Q/VNo2kdw4ot8/s640/Matrix_067Pyxurz.jpg)\n\nA few months ago a new disruptive technology came to the world. It allowed all sorts content creators to make some income doing what they love, all while bypassing the restrictive censorship of armies of gate keepers around the world. And since you\u2019re reading this, then you\u2019re probably using it too.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, when what you do is truly amazing, you can\u2019t really expect that no one else is going to try to replicate it. In fact, the strange thing would be that if no one was ever going to attempt to create \u201cthe new steemit\u201d.\n\nAfter all, competition is a part of life, and it\u2019s almost here so maybe it\u2019s time we talked about it.\n\n# Dancing with Mr. Ying and Miss Yang\n\nOn the positive side, competition can make us stronger and more connected. All those small debates and unnecessary dramas would suddenly take a back seat to more important matters. \n\nIt can motivate us to up our game and take it to the next level. It can encourage us to keep improving so we don\u2019t get too comfortable. It can help us realize what we have, and not take it for granted. \n\n![Alt Text](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TVDMaHEL61w/U1_ZuVFcttI/AAAAAAAAMvg/dt0wlqDLFWI/s1600/living+in+the+matrix.jpg)\n\nBut there's another way  to approach competition, the Yang way, where you can go to that room where you archive all those things that you can\u2019t control, head towards the door and kick it wide open. Just sit there and let fear invade you.\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but believe it or not, the second most common thing people do in face of competition is to fear it and let them rush into making unnecessary decisions. Now, I don\u2019t know about you but to me panic doesn\u2019t precisely strike me as a solid strategy.\n\nHowever, I do understand why some people might experience some concerns. *\"Look, there\u2019s a new competition, they have a brand new website, their logo looks so professionally made, their name is so catchy. Hell, they even have shiny shoes\u2026\"* \n\nFrom that point on, it will be just a matter of time until this question starts circling around: *What if people start pouring there?*\n\nI hate to break it to you, but these things can and will probably happen.\n\nA few steemians will move there and that\u2019s ok. In fact, that\u2019s very understandable, they will have their reasons. Maybe they go on their own, or maybe they will have an offer to join. \n\nSo when that happens, there are two things that you can do:\n\nYou can worry that people are migrating elsewhere, or you can remember the \u201csecret\u201d: That they will never stop making people. \n\nPlus, if that if the goal is expansion, then it\u2019s a comfort knowing that the journey hasn\u2019t changed and that we\u2019re still on the same course.\n\n# Destination Moon\n\nThat  are enough potential users in the planet for everyone, they will never stop making people, remember? \n\nPlus, if the dream was grow and reach hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people, then nothing has really changed in the grand scheme of things. right?\n\nMaybe a few will leave and it\u2019s ok, maybe they\u2019ll come back quickly afterwards, maybe they won\u2019t or maybe this is a good opportunity to remember:\n\n## That moon we all talked about, our moon, is still the goal.\n\n![Alt Text](https://s9.postimg.io/ptqv6s6of/Untitled_design.png)\n\n*Picture dedicated to @smooth.  Thank you for the logo advice!*\n\n# A View from the Future\n\nSo in the future if you read some open letters from some prominent writers explaining why they moved away to the competition, so maybe we don't need to give these things more importance than they deserve.\n\nSometimes diversification is a smart move, sometimes people need to look for what\u2019s best for them, and sometimes they look for whatever they perceive as such. Whatever the case may be, it\u2019s still their choice and they are free to change their minds.\n\nAnd yes, we will probably read a few editorial posts about *\u201cWhy I left steemit for X\u201d* and maybe a little worry might circle your train of thought. \n\nMaybe their reasons are totally valid, or maybe they\u2019re unconsciously making up a story with which they can justify it to themselves. So all of the sudden every small problem is magnified and the grass on the other side looks greener. It happens.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s not our place to judge them.\n\nAnd yes, the preachers of doom will jump at the opportunity to parade their psychic abilities, *See? People are leaving steemit already. I told you!*, but when that happens please remember that we\u2019re talking about people who never let a good crisis go to waste. So whatever they say should probably be taken with a fine pure grain of Himalayan salt.\n\nThese are things that we can\u2019t control, here\u2019s what we can do.\n\nWe can step up, we can up our game, we can show them what this platform has already proved, we can remember why we joined and that maybe, just maybe show them that we are still fighting for that fucking moon.\n\nBecause let\u2019s not forget, steem is third behind Bitcoin and Ether.\n\n### And just as Bitcoin had so many new competing coins that were going to completely erase it from the map, we\u2019ll probably hear the same song again.\n\n![Alt Text](http://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2014/11/04/27691a45-1606-4647-9093-637886cc89be/forecast-crystal-ball-prediction.jpg)\n\nThere will be many death predictions too. Bitcoin had about a hundred of them, so don't be surprised when that happens.\n\nBut what if I\u2019m wrong and the competition is very strong?\n\nWell then we learn to compete better. Competition is a part of life, and it can make you better if you know how to approach it. In fact, [I wrote about the subject in the past](https://steemit.com/life/@the-alien/blasts-from-the-past-lessons-from-running-a-bar-at-a-young-age).\n\nSo this goes for those of us who experienced the life changing abilities of this platform, and especially for those who are crazy enough to still believe in the same dream that we are at the beginning  stages of a beautiful game changer. For those who still have the same passion about disruptiveness as in the first day, here\u2019s something that we can do:\n\n# We Can Bet on Our Strengths\n\n![Alt Text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm8iJ91XEAIVokI.jpg)\n\nWe can focus on what steemit has achieved already and introduce it to the world. How many people have made some good income already? How many projects has steemit helped? How many it has brought in to life? How many relationships have been forged?\n\nSo maybe you\u2019re a filmmaker looking for a good story, maybe you can make a documentary about the lives that steemit has changed and its future effects on society, maybe the rest of us can help you.\n\nMaybe I should listen to my own words and lead by example. Maybe I should carve out some time and finally launch my very own book that was born out of pure steem.\n\nOr maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to do anything at all. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have to step up our game just yet, and ignore any competition.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I just want you to know that if you\u2019re here for the long run, than you should know that more competition will come, and when that happens don\u2019t listen to the alarming voices and trust your own judgement.\n\nI want you to know that it\u2019s not the end, that this is the beginning and that I hope that you\u2019re still enjoying this beautifully game changing ride and not planning to give up your seat just yet.\n\n#### Image Sources: [1](http://dailyseoblog.com/how-to-discover-your-competitions-seo-strategies/) - [2](http://pyxurz.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/matrix-page-2-of-7.html) - [3](http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/16-signs-that-you-are-slave-living-in.html)- [4](http://wallpaper.zone/carlsberg-wallpaper) - [5](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/peering-into-the-crystal-ball-it-leader-predict-major-tech-trends/) - [6](https://twitter.com/riaali4)",

It such a rife subject even in developed nations that political ambitions can be made or broken depending on one's stance about this. Unfortunately so many people have failed to realize that this is quite a private subject for men. There are circumstances that stem up and would make a man have to make a serious decision about his health and his future.\n\nTherefore no socio-political, cultural or religious factor should be made to take the place of his decision. A man should have the right to choose whether he wants to keep a child or not. After all it is his wallet, his wealth and his future that is in jeopardy.\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft2.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcReT4wovWfBByJ2G5q0g7NtdeBNiEBw3UkbpzxENjTi7jhH6LDYzQ&sp=e88be8f88c2ebf5e6b418d469f046195)\n\nIt is, however, unfortunate that a lot of countries continue to criminalize and shame so-called \"dead-beat dads\" even when the wealth of the father is at stake.\n\nFor instance a man called Terry Power. *His face tightened as he listened to his wife's attorney tick off their assets on the final day of his divorce trial. He sat in a leather chair at a glass-covered table inside a paneled judicial chamber and he thought not for the first time that her voice annoyed him.*\n\n*The Jet Ski . . . his wife's attorney said.*\n\n*\"Sold to pay attorney fees,\" Terry interjected.*\n\n*The IRA account?*\n\n*\"Distributed to pay property taxes on the marital property.\"*\n\n*The Raymond James investment account?*\n\n*\"Gone.\"*\n\n*Terry's wife, Murielle, petite with blond highlights, stared at him as if he were an insect, then looked down at her hands. After five years in divorce court, they were like old prizefighters in their respective corners.*\n\n*In February 2008, when Murielle Marie Helene Fournier vs. Terrance Paul Power was but a single document inside a purple file at the Pinellas County Courthouse, when Terry had his own business and made $250,000 a year, he thought of divorce court as a place where grievances were smoothed over and order restored. Now as he represented himself in his own divorce trial because he couldn't afford an attorney, his case having grown to 28 volumes and costing about $400,000 (much of it still unpaid), he viewed the system of marital justice as a journey down the rabbit hole.*\n\n*The gold coins?*\n\n*\"I have no idea.\"*\n\n*The hutch?*\n\n*\"Sold.\"*\n\n*As their divorce trial concluded, Murielle's attorney finally got around to alimony, the issue that had bogged down the case from the start. Terry had delivered his first of six alimony offers to Murielle a month after the divorce was filed: $5,400 a month until he retired, plus $50,000 cash and half the contents of their million-dollar home, which was underwater. The last letter, delivered to her attorney the month before the trial, offered her zero.*\n\n*\"Frankly I don't give a crap if she settles or not,\" he had written. \"I'd rather see her waste even more money. Like she made me do for these past four years.\"*\n\n*Now Murielle's attorney suggested a different amount: \"She's 50 years old and she doesn't have many skills, Judge . . . $6,500 a month should keep her in a decent place.\"*\n\n*Terry rolled his eyes.*\n\n*(adapted from [here](http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/the-divorce-from-hell-the-battle-for-alimony-and-emptied-pockets/2112875))*\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTmQO0c1JzFPIMQa8Ru-GZ7uNCxPWjtmSjsXXAPtrF28Vpp_Emaow&sp=1c9cf8d87d7d7625aba83f15e30270f3)\n\nMarriage is a very risky condition for the modern man and a lot of men are going to run into complications during this period and suicide is going to be their only saving grace. To cancel this option before hand for them is very inhumane thing to do as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n![](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1906336.1408258966!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/news-robinwilliams-obit-2-la.jpg)\n\nIn another sad antithetical case, men in most countries are being forced to pay alimony when they clearly do not want such procedures carried out on them. In the United States, in order to uphold the nonsensical drivel of feminist policy, men are forced to go to jail if they refuse to pay - even if the child is not theirs!\n\nIn Switzerland, as many other places, men are forbidden from seeing their children, many times due to false allegations on the part of the mother. It is referred to as female deception. [Recently a new born baby girl was found in a dumpster and had to be rushed to the hospital to received urgent medical attention](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/london-ont-police-charge-23-year-old-mother-two-days-after-dead-baby-found-in-dumpster).\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTqkHuavHk3tNlbtsfZBsUMPdGt6YUNf3b6AmoqFh-F-wd3DWJL-g&sp=dfc9275990e22e1e14f3e6bc00de0df2)\n\nThere are other cases where a man should be allowed to have a future. For example if he is not ready, financially, to support a child it is very unhealthy for such a gentleman to be forced to carry that child to adulthood. Many gentlemen have had to quit school in order to take up poor paying jobs to support a child they were not ready to have. For the welfare of father and child, young gentlemen should be allowed to make decisions on whether they want to keep paying or not.\n\n![](https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft3.gstatic.com%2Fimages%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcTcjI0bLH3GAUML1JKT0gnY073u7KcK6nxcxuz_XM_DOtJslMI6SA&sp=ffe625608bf04a3406b769867fbfab1e)\n\nMost men also get broke from horrifying experiences like divorce rape and to force such a gentleman to keep a child that will only remind him of an unfortunate and painful wife is very wicked. Most people will argue that divorce involves taking the life of an innocent man but they are just a mass of undeveloped testicles that are not even a complete human yet. It doesn't even have a developed nervous system yet and as such cannot feel emotions. And it is even sad that most religions try to guilt people into keeping a marriage at the expense of the husbands's happiness. The fathers\u2019s decision should always hold supreme as it is his wallet and he should have the final decision on what he wants to do with it. And he can always live to have healthy babies in the future.\n\n![](http://www.brocode.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/brobama.jpg)",

    "body": "<html>\n<p>Shit gets rough every now and then. Life is a pain and sometimes you just need something to pick yourself up out of a rut and into a new mind frame.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are 5 simple things you can do if you are not having the greatest day. They can simply change your mood and take you from one negative state to a more optimistic and <a href=\"www.instagram.com\">positive one.&nbsp;</a></p>\n<h2><img src=\"http://www.in-spirelsmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Think-Positive-In-spire-LS-Magazine-2.jpg\"/></h2>\n<h2>1. Put on your Jam And Throw Away Some Junk&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Yup pump up your latest \"jam\" and start throwing junk out! One way to decide what to throw out is ask your self these two questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When was the last time I used this? If the answer is 6 months ago or more....then...</li>\n  <li>Do I really need to keep it? Or can it go to a better home.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. One persons trash is another persons treasure.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Don't just throw it in the bin, pass it on to a new home. Go donate it. Someone can probably put it to good use! So this is a sure fire way to start a chain of positivity. Act positive and you will be positive.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3. Surround Yourself With Humour And A Good Friend.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Pick up the phone and say hello to a friend. Have a laugh, get your funny endorphins rolling around in your body. There is no better way to do this than to make a connection with someone and have a giggle.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Reminisce A Little&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>This is an odd one, but the brain often glorifies good moments in your life. So pull out the photo album of your last wild getaway or family holiday and have a think of the good times. This will put a smile on your dial.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5. Plan Something</h2>\n<p>Last but not least put a plan on paper, book a little trip, book a night out and go to the cinemas. We all need to have things we look forward to on a weekly basis, this is the stuff that keeps you going . You place the light at the end of the tunnel no on else. So turn on the light and plan a little night :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I hope you found these helpful. They are things I do all the time if I'm not feeling the best! Share with us below what you do. :)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>#steemit #steemzine #psychology #life &nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>",

My response of 'mining' was quickly met with an elongated pause with 'huh?' immediately proceeding. It was in this moment which I was stuck with the daunting task of making my best attempt to explain exactly what the heck I was doing. Recalling my prior failed efforts to accurately explain this to others, I decided on a different approach. I'm not sure how this came about as I had not invested any time on this analogy prior, but I simply said, 'Mining Steem and crypto-currencies is like being a Taxi Driver.'</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"http://hireagreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cab.jpg\"/></center></p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http://hireagreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Cab.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<h2>What does a Taxi Driver do?</h2>\n<blockquote>A taxi driver is a professional driver who transports passengers to their chosen destinations through the use of a taxi cab. By transporting their passengers, they earn a fare depending on the length of the taxi cab ride.</blockquote>\n<p>https://www.sokanu.com/careers/taxi-driver/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Why does one want to be a Taxi Driver?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>They earn a fare</li>\n  <li>They enjoy driving</li>\n  <li>They are comforatable being in a vehicle</li>\n  <li>They like the company of others</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why does one want to be Miner?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>they earn a reward</li>\n  <li>they enjoy technology</li>\n  <li>they are comfortable being on a computer</li>\n  <li>they like crypto-currencies</li>\n</ol><center>\n<h2>Just for the Money?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/653*367/stripper+generic+black+white.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/653*367/stripper+generic+black+white.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Before venturing into the first desire above, it is important to realize that cumulative weight of secondary motivations and beyond are typically necessary to achieve the fare/reward. From my understanding (and definitely not from waking up in the morning hundreds of dollars short than when I started the night prior!) individuals who dance and take their clothes off can make a very large 'fare/reward' as well! Knowing this, doesn't that mean I should do that too?! For me, the answer is a hard NO. I personally do not have the confidence, dancing abilities or free-natured spirit those individuals have. In the same light, a person who despises driving, is scared in a vehicle and loathes the company of others, likely wouldn't make a very good Taxi Driver. Lastly, individuals who are scared of technology, frightened by computers and do not want to be around crypto-currencies would have a difficult time mining.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<center><h2>Now that we understand how important the combined weight of secondary motivations are to one's decision to become either a Taxi Driver or a Miner, let's explore how exactly a fare/reward is made.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.marilynomalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MoneyMap.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marilynomalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MoneyMap.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The job of the Taxi Driver is to navigate geographic terrain to a specified location provided by the passenger. Payment of a fare from the passenger to the Taxi Driver is confirmation that the job was executed successfully.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>In terms of mining, the job of the miner is to navigate digital data in an attempt to verify digital contracts and transfers from other users (passengers). Payment of a reward from other users to the miner is confirmation that the digital data was successfully verified. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the Taxi Driver is unsuccessful and drops the passenger off at a different location, or his vehicle breaks down, the passenger does not need to provide compensation regardless of how close they are. Even if the Taxi Driver arrives at the correct location but several hours later than originally required, compensation may and probably won't be provided.</li>\n  <li>If a miner is unsuccessful in verifying assigned transactions of digital data, no reward will be provided. If the miner confirms transactions hours or days later, no reward will be provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Ok, so this seems broad enough for most individuals to understand. Let us explore what is required to make all this happen.&nbsp;</h2>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4d/21/3c/4d213c01fdfc017db9394ecd19a2dffc.jpg\" width=\"736\" height=\"920\"/></center></p>\n<p><center><a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4d/21/3c/4d213c01fdfc017db9394ecd19a2dffc.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Taxi Drivers should have the following items in order to receive a fare:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A Vehicle --- The Taxi Driver does not need to own one. Some Taxi Drivers work for a company who provide one to them for a cost.</li>\n  <li>Gasoline</li>\n  <li>A Map/GPS</li>\n  <li>A pocket for cash payments or a Credit Card machine to take payments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Miners should have the following items in order to receive a reward: &nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A Computer --- The Miner does not need to own one. Some Miners pay for a computer in the 'cloud.' If a miner chooses this option, a fee will be paid from the Miner to the company providing the computer.</li>\n  <li>Electricity</li>\n  <li>An interface which provides their computer with the information they need to verify</li>\n  <li>A digital wallet to receive payment of their rewards</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br></p><center>\n<h2>I have all of those items! So now I need to sit at my computer all day and actively mine?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxgdqeHIut1qcpel0.jpg\" width=\"251\" height=\"205\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxgdqeHIut1qcpel0.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Nope. When you first get in to a Taxi it is stationary and the driver is paying attention to you to find out where you want to go. From there,&nbsp;the driver typically has a conversation on his phone, chit-chats with you, drinks coffee, eats and obsessively blows his horn. The actual driving of the vehicle for the Taxi Driver is second nature to him and he has an amazing ability to multi-task. The Taxi Driver did all of those&nbsp;things for your entire trip but ultimately he got you to your destination... so you paid him.</p>\n<p>The same goes for mining. You turn on your computer and point the mining program to it's digital destination. From there you are able to&nbsp;minimize the program and do anything else you so choose to. The computer knows in the background what needs to be done and just does it for&nbsp;you.</p>\n<p><br></p><center>\n<h2>Are you telling me that I can Mine while streaming Netflix and building a huge customer database for my company at the same time?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://lisasatomidotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc04533-e1406962297583.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lisasatomidotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/dsc04533-e1406962297583.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Everything has limitations. For the Taxi Driver who uses a Ford Focus for a vehicle, it would be quite difficult for him to pick of a family of 15&nbsp;Sumo Wrestlers. This is difficult for two reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The Taxi Driver will likely not have the space in his Ford Focus for the family.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>If&nbsp;he is Harry Houdini and somehow fits them all in, the weight of the car will be so tremendous it would take hours to arrive at the&nbsp;destination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The same is true for your computer. Mining requires you to have memory and processing power. The Memory is equivalent to the space inside of&nbsp;the Ford Focus. The Processing Power is equivalent to the speed of the Ford Focus. If your other activities take up a lot of memory, or slow down&nbsp;your computer's speed, then it is recommended to using the mining tool when you are not actively using your computer.</p>\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae329/lzsleggs/currency/NYTransittokensideA.jpg\" width=\"384\" height=\"352\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i984.photobucket.com/albums/ae329/lzsleggs/currency/NYTransittokensideA.jpg\">Image Credit</a></center></p>\n<p>Admittingly this analogy does not afford a person the resources to go and create CabCoin anytime soon. It was sufficient enough however for Trena who told me that she understood and appreciated the explanation. After which came another elongated pause and then she asked, 'So, we're going to become millionaires now?!'</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgsafe.org/dd8bd8753d.gif\" width=\"156\" height=\"70\"/></p>\n</center><center><p>Please share, upvote and follow if you enjoyed this Original Content.

    "body": "## Summary\nThis post introduces two new statistics about influences on rewards with the consideration of the leverage of Steem Power (IPR) to provide more through understanding about the whale issue.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe whale issue of Steem is one of the most frequently debated topic from its beginning. But we still do not have through understanding regarding the current situations, such as how much whales have influences on rewards, or how unequal the situation is. In this post, I would like to introduce two new statistics, 1) Influences on (author) rewards, 2) Influence to Steem Power Ratio (IPR), to provide more comprehensive knowledge about the whale issue.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\nThe data is from Steem blockchain from 2016/8/16 (After v0.13.0) to 2016/9/8.\nInfluences of whales on rewards is calculated based on the following equations.\n\n```\n- Rshares of a post: sum(voters_rshares)\n- Vshares of a post: (posts_rshares)^2\n- Daily vshares: sum(posts_vshares)\n- Voter's vshares on a post: posts_vshares * (voters_rshares / posts_rshares)\n- Voter's daily vshares: sum(voters_vshares)\n- Voter's influence: voters_daily_vshares / daily_vshares\n```\n\nTo get IPR, we just need a simple equation.\n```\n- IPR = Influence / (voters_vests / total_vests)\n```\n*Note: Steemit account's vests are excluded from total_vests*\n\n\n## Results\n\nRank | Account | Influence(%) | Steem Power (%) | IPR\n:----:|:----:|----|----|----\n1\t|\tsmooth\t|\t13.34\t|\t2.86\t|\t4.67\n2\t|\tblocktrades\t|\t11.60\t|\t3.71\t|\t3.13\n3\t|\tberniesanders\t|\t10.55\t|\t2.97\t|\t3.55\n4\t|\tsteemed\t|\t3.92\t|\t1.62\t|\t2.42\n5\t|\titsascam\t|\t3.82\t|\t1.53\t|\t2.49\n6\t|\ttombstone\t|\t3.62\t|\t1.87\t|\t1.93\n7\t|\tdantheman\t|\t3.51\t|\t2.54\t|\t1.38\n8\t|\tsummon\t|\t3.11\t|\t1.29\t|\t2.41\n9\t|\tjamesc\t|\t2.78\t|\t3.20\t|\t0.87\n10\t|\tcomplexring\t|\t2.37\t|\t0.67\t|\t3.52\n11\t|\tsmooth.witness\t|\t2.32\t|\t0.53\t|\t4.37\n12\t|\twang\t|\t1.97\t|\t0.66\t|\t2.97\n13\t|\tnextgencrypto\t|\t1.81\t|\t0.51\t|\t3.53\n14\t|\trainman\t|\t1.78\t|\t1.51\t|\t1.18\n15\t|\trecursive\t|\t1.56\t|\t0.31\t|\t5.11\n16\t|\tsilversteem\t|\t1.55\t|\t0.46\t|\t3.39\n17\t|\triverhead\t|\t1.53\t|\t0.68\t|\t2.23\n18\t|\tpharesim\t|\t1.53\t|\t0.88\t|\t1.74\n19\t|\tned\t|\t1.52\t|\t5.73\t|\t0.27\n20\t|\tsteemit200\t|\t1.38\t|\t0.57\t|\t2.42\n21\t|\tsteempty\t|\t1.30\t|\t0.69\t|\t1.87\n22\t|\tkushed\t|\t1.15\t|\t0.50\t|\t2.29\n23\t|\txeldal\t|\t1.15\t|\t0.64\t|\t1.79\n24\t|\thr1\t|\t1.00\t|\t0.21\t|\t4.69\n25\t|\tsatoshifund\t|\t0.99\t|\t0.35\t|\t2.85\n26\t|\tenki\t|\t0.91\t|\t0.53\t|\t1.71\n27\t|\tval-a\t|\t0.91\t|\t2.80\t|\t0.32\n28\t|\tsilver\t|\t0.74\t|\t0.19\t|\t3.85\n29\t|\tau1nethyb1\t|\t0.72\t|\t0.42\t|\t1.71\n30\t|\tbadassmother\t|\t0.63\t|\t0.26\t|\t2.44\n\nSurprisingly, top 10 have about 60% (actually over 60% since `smooth` and `smooth.witness` is controlled by same person) of author rewards, while they only have 22% of Steem Power. And the top 3 (`smooth`, `blocktrades`, `berniesanders` consist of 35.5% of influences, for instance, if daily author reward is $20,000, about $7,000 is from these three's voting activities. The average IPR of the top 10 is 2.63, but if we do the same calculation with rank 41~50, they only have IPR of 0.75. This means that influences on rewards is unequally distributed, more specifically it is biased to some whales.\n\n![](http://i.imgsafe.org/26684444a1.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, I calculated some basic statics about top rankers voting patterns.\n\n- Range: Number of unique writers they voted for\n- Mean: Average number of votes per writer\n- Max: Maximum number of votes on a writer\n- Stdev: Standard deviation of votes\n\nRank | Account | Range | Mean | Max | Stdev\n:----:|:----:|----|----|----|----\n1\t|\tsmooth\t|\t340\t|\t2.32\t|\t65\t|\t7.49\n2\t|\tblocktrades\t|\t480\t|\t1.31\t|\t22.4\t|\t1.51\n3\t|\tberniesanders\t|\t785\t|\t1.27\t|\t14.5\t|\t1.7\n4\t|\tsteemed\t|\t80\t|\t3.64\t|\t44\t|\t6.43\n5\t|\titsascam\t|\t79\t|\t3.69\t|\t44\t|\t6.49\n6\t|\ttombstone\t|\t196\t|\t1.64\t|\t12.1\t|\t2.18\n7\t|\tdantheman\t|\t339\t|\t0.66\t|\t10.3\t|\t1.23\n8\t|\tsummon\t|\t220\t|\t1.65\t|\t14.4\t|\t1.99\n9\t|\tjamesc\t|\t135\t|\t1.1\t|\t12.8\t|\t1.81\n10\t|\tcomplexring\t|\t534\t|\t1.75\t|\t39\t|\t3.04\n11\t|\tsmooth.witness\t|\t324\t|\t2.4\t|\t65\t|\t7.61\n12\t|\twang\t|\t213\t|\t8.29\t|\t82\t|\t10.41\n13\t|\tnextgencrypto\t|\t755\t|\t1.4\t|\t14\t|\t1.51\n14\t|\trainman\t|\t170\t|\t1.18\t|\t9.7\t|\t1.3\n15\t|\trecursive\t|\t121\t|\t9.78\t|\t51\t|\t11.76\n16\t|\tsilversteem\t|\t760\t|\t1.82\t|\t15\t|\t2.08\n17\t|\triverhead\t|\t334\t|\t1.53\t|\t12.6\t|\t1.4\n18\t|\tpharesim\t|\t404\t|\t2.03\t|\t54\t|\t3.89\n19\t|\tned\t|\t238\t|\t0.18\t|\t2.6\t|\t0.35\n20\t|\tsteemit200\t|\t175\t|\t2.41\t|\t13\t|\t2.29\n21\t|\tsteempty\t|\t164\t|\t2.89\t|\t34\t|\t4.84\n22\t|\tkushed\t|\t250\t|\t2.61\t|\t84\t|\t7.36\n23\t|\txeldal\t|\t204\t|\t2.92\t|\t48\t|\t5.65\n24\t|\thr1\t|\t104\t|\t10.34\t|\t52\t|\t11.86\n25\t|\tsatoshifund\t|\t130\t|\t2.51\t|\t21\t|\t3.61\n26\t|\tenki\t|\t174\t|\t3.22\t|\t46\t|\t5.58\n27\t|\tval-a\t|\t75\t|\t0.36\t|\t1.5\t|\t0.42\n28\t|\tsilver\t|\t763\t|\t1.83\t|\t15\t|\t2.13\n29\t|\tau1nethyb1\t|\t205\t|\t1.97\t|\t11\t|\t1.79\n30\t|\tbadassmother\t|\t235\t|\t2.75\t|\t15\t|\t2.77\n\n\n\nAmong these statistics, max and stdev should be highlighted, since higher numbers imply that a whale's voting is very concentrated (possibily due to his/her preferences or favorable connection with authors?), and this can further create perception of inequality. (People recursively see high rewards on same author's posts). For comparison, while `blocktrades` and `berniesanders` have similar influences with `smooth`, they have much lower max and stdev, which implies that their votes are widely dispersed to many writers. But we can see very high max and stdev in `hr1`, `recursive`, `wang`, and `smooth`. In addition, we can find `smooth` and `smooth.witness`, and `recursive` and `hr1` have the similar patterns respectively, probably because each pair of accounts is using the same voting bot.\n\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nThe results show that influence is much higher than whales' actual steem power, especially by active whale bots. In my humble opinion, the fundamental cause is the squared rshares, which makes large voting power much greater. We need further discussion about this issue and have to address it for better Steem society.\n\n\n### P.S. Do you think that I have to post these stats everyday, weekly, or monthly? (Everyday data has influence and IPR only because the second table requires more samples)",

    "body": "_Firstly, I must admit I have spent more time thinking about Steem(it) than I have been paid for by it. And to be honest (and disappointing to readers/whales and me as far as payouts go) I have found more than a few BIG Problems with Steem. Problems that if not addressed, will lead to its ultimate failure. Now, you might not agree with me (very likely) but they will.\nAnd I love Steem and I do think it is a few shorts changes short of being \u201cThe Game Changer\u201d!_\n#\n![steemit image](https://steemit.com/images/steemit-share.png)\n#\nOK that was the intro, now to the point\u2026\n#\n I consider [Why I Want to Short Steem  [Beyond Trading \u2013part2. 08/23/2016](https://steemit.com/steemit/@james-show/why-i-want-to-short-steem-beyond-trading-part2-08-23-2016) post of mine, the greatest insight in the Steem space, that I (and most writers that I have come across) ever got. \nI also totally understand why most of you will find the believes of mine expressed  there \u201cstupid\u201d \u201csilly\u201d \u201coutdated\u201d, but that take of yours does not makes them invalid or not true. Actually they are as true as when Adam Smith first thought of them\u2026.\n# Back to the present\u2026\nYes, I do __not__ believe; \u201cThe company\u2019s worth is what N million customers are worth to Facebook (or 100 times more in Steemit\u2019s case)\u201d,  especially when the company has NO CLUE how to monetize on those customers\u2026.\n#\n__And today this changed (maybe alittle, maybe alot [1]) by the introduction of \u201cpromoted posts\u201d__\nWith _promoted posts_ we can see how the system / all Steem power holders can benefit from someone trying to come to the system and pay his way in to all SP holders!\n#\nIt is a great new feature! The best in my humble opinion. The best I have seen from Steem really.\nAnd that\u2019s why I will _donate_ ( donate more or less really) a good sum of SD to put this (Badly written as far as English grammar and spelling go) post on that same list.\n-------\nOther (mostly less controversial posts of mine): \n1.

    "body": "**Currently, there are two ways to get a STEEM Account.** The first is to sign up for Steemit with a Reddit or Facebook account, the second is to create an account using CLI_WALLET or Piston and have the account **permanently linked to your own account.**\n\nNeither option really allows you to be anonymous. Want to post controversial posts, or say something that would otherwise be illegal in your country? (e.g. poor free speech laws) Then Anonsteem is here to help.\n\n## Introducing: @anonsteem\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y6QDDbD.png)\n\nPUBLIC INTERNET: [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network/)\n----\n\nTOR: [steemlohs6air4h2.onion](http://steemlohs6air4h2.onion/)\n----\n\n----\n\n**So what actually is this?**\n\nAnonSteem allows you to purchase an account using either Bitcoin or Litecoin, and it will be created by the @anonsteem account within a minute of payment.\n\nTo protect your privacy, there are no IP logs, we have a TOR hidden service, and we allow you to remove your keys from our server as soon as you create the account.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4aa6tR7.png)\n\nWe give you detailed instructions on changing your keys after creating the account, so you can be sure we're not just going to steal your account later on.\n\nHow long does it take to get an account?\n-----\n\nTransactions are scanned once a minute, and we accept 0 confirmation transactions. This means you'll most likely have your account within 1-2 minutes of sending the payment, regardless of which coin you paid with.\n\nCan I pay with STEEM?\n----\n\nWe don't accept STEEM directly, as that would ruin your privacy. However, if you REALLY want to pay with STEEM, you can send it via [ShapeShift (precise mode)](https://shapeshift.io/#/inputs/2) to the BTC or LTC address you get during payment.\n\nDoesn't this service mean more spambots?\n----\n\nWe don't have any plans to allow en-masse account creation. Every order has to be placed one at a time, with individual payments. Someone looking to create spam bots would most likely look elsewhere.\n\nAnonsteem is targeted at persons or groups looking for one, or a few accounts, with no social media link, and no third party tracking.\n\n**HELP - my transaction expired?** - The 15 minute limit is just to avoid us checking transactions for abandoned orders. If you've already paid, just PM me on SteemitChat, or send me an email (bottom of the anonsteem page) with your order ID and I'll reset the expiry.\n\nTry it out at [anon.steem.network](https://anon.steem.network)\n----\n\nDo you like what I'm doing? Follow me, and [vote for @someguy123 to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses)\n====",

    "body": "http://www.steem101.com/facebooktest.jpg\n# My Facebook and Steemit experiment:\n### Two days ago @ around 8:00 am EST I posted an article about my little sweetheart named Jalyn.  She made \"Fall off the bone ribs\" and we documented her work with a video.\n\n### I then posted it on Steemit and Facebook at the exact same time.  \n*  Steemit: I had 68 followers at the time of the post.\n*  Facebook: I had 224 friends, family, coworkers at the time of the post.\n\n---\n\n## Here is a snapshot of both posts:\n\nSteemit Post:            |  FaceBook Post:\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](http://www.steem101.com/Steemit.jpg )  |  ![](http://www.steem101.com/facebook.jpg )\n\n\n\n| Steemit:  |    FaceBook    |  \n|----------|:-------------:|\n| 44 Up Votes |  7 Likes |\n| 4 Comments |    5 Comments  |\n| No Shares | 1 Share |\n| $84.66 | Zero - Cheap Bastards |\n\n## Summary:\nI thought it would be compelling to see how many votes I received with both Social Media Sites.  I found it very interesting that the number of Up Votes from the Steemit Community was more than 6 times the number of Likes from my Facebook Friends.  The reason I found this interesting is because I have 224 Facebook friends and I have known them a lot longer than my new friends at Steemit.  \n\nAnother interesting point is the fact I have been on Facebook for over 6 years.  I have been on Steemit for 2 months.   Looks like my Steemit Friends are more interested in what I have to share..... \n\nIt will also be interesting when I show my Facebook friends this little experiment.\nEspecially the part about the $84.66\n\n## Action:\nStop going to Facebook!\n\n#steemit #facebook #life #craigrant",

If every day, or every week this account (we\u2019ll be shifting to a new account shortly @advertise) be in the top five on the promo tab and you pay $3-5 you will reap the rewards of being on the top of SteemIt! Promote Post as a minnow is turning out to be a problem for [some](https://steemit.com/steemit/@profitgenerator/analysis-promoted-content) so the power of many seems more logical. \n\nAlso, going forward we\u2019ll be throwing the same amount daily/weekly, or even more toward the post reaching the top. As it stands $100 can get us all on the front page of SteemIt Promote. If 40 of us minnows throw in $5 for the day we can sit our submissions on top. Not only that **ALL SBD** that are earned by this post will go into \u201cpromote post\u201d itself thus helping you get free future advertising for your submissions! We\u2019ll be building out this post as we go as you can see we have a \u201cServices\u201d Category.\n\nIf you wish to get our upvote, just tag us with a SteemIt tag of **#upliftminnows** and we\u2019ll find your post. All proceeds of the post will go back to you so essentially you could have a free advertisement.\n<h2>How to Participate: </h2>\n\n<li>Simply, comment below with your story submission, or service and we\u2019ll add it to the page. Hit \u2018promote post\u2019 and send whatever amount you can and 'pool' it together with all other minnows. Put the $ amount you posted in your comment also. <b>Example: @joesmith $5 ( your link here )</b>.\n<br><br>\n<li>We will post the link you provide via a comment below to the post.\n<br><br>\n<li>The highest paying post will lead the list first and roll off the page after 20 entries.\n<br><br>\n<li>This post will last forever and each day/week a new post will be put up and  your listing could be carried over.\n<br><br>\n</li>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note</strong> <br>\nFor this very first launch we are adding $50 to the pool. You may add as much as you want to this post, or as little as you want to get listed on <b>Uplift Minnows Initiative</b>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n \n<p><center><hr></center></p>\n <h2 id=\"steemit-story-submissions\"><center><strong>SteemIt Story Submissions:</strong></center></h2>\n<p><center><hr></center></p> \n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://payscape.com/wp-content/uploads/icon-globe-blue.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"></center><p></p>\n \n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemtools/@kurtrohlandt/steemit-image-tools-pimp-your-posts\">SD- $6 | @kurtrohlandt: Steemit Image Tools - Pimp your posts</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steem/@williambanks/do-you-feel-taler-gnu-foundation-launches-their-own-cryptocoin\">SD- $5 | @williambanks: Do You Feel Taler? - GNU Foundation Launches Their Own Cryptocoin!</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/life/@michelle.gent/i-went-to-the-beach-and-i-cried\">SD- $5 | @michelle.gent: I went to the beach and I cried</a></b></center><p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><center><img src=\"https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/ionicons/512/icon-arrow-right-b-128.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" title=\"\"><b><a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemit/@me-tarzan/win-500-steempower-enter-steemit-daily-sweepstakes-100-winners-everyday\">SD- $2 | @me-tarzan: WIN !!!!! 500 !!!!!STEEMPOWER !!!!!.....

I am editor-in-chief of the Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten. I am writing this letter to inform you that I shall not comply with your requirement to remove a documentary photography from the Vietnam war made by Nick Ut.\n\nNot today, and not in the future.\n\nThe demand that we remove the picture came in an e-mail from Facebook\u2019s office in Hamburg this Wednesday morning. Less than 24 hours after the e-mail was sent, and before I had time to give my response, you intervened yourselves and deleted the article as well as the image from Aftenposten\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nTo be honest, I have no illusions that you will read this letter. The reason why I will still make this attempt, is that I am upset, disappointed \u2013 well, in fact even afraid - of what you are about to do to a mainstay of our democratic society.\n\nFirst some background. A few weeks ago the Norwegian author Tom Egeland posted an entry on Facebook about, and including, seven photographs that changed the history of warfare. You in turn removed the picture of a naked Kim Phuc, fleeing from the napalm bombs \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most famous war photographs.\n\nTom then rendered Kim Phuc\u2019s criticism against Facebook for banning her picture. Facebook reacted by excluding Tom and prevented him from posting a new entry.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/fab84404-efd8-4651-97fb-23fc195b5abb?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<center><sup>Aftenposten's Editor-in-chief Espen Egil Hansen.</sup></center>\n</div>\nListen, Mark, this is serious. First you create rules that don\u2019t distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs. Then you practice these rules without allowing space for good judgement. Finally you even censor criticism against and a discussion about the decision \u2013 and you punish the person who dares to voice criticism.\n\nFacebook is for the pleasure and benefit of the whole world, myself included, on a number of levels. I myself, for instance, keep in touch with my brothers via a closed group centered on our 89 year old father. Day by day we share joys and concerns.\n\nFacebook has become a world-leading platform for spreading information, for debate and for social contact between persons. You have gained this position because you deserve it.\n\nBut, dear Mark, you are the world\u2019s most powerful editor. Even for a major player like Aftenposten, Facebook is hard to avoid. In fact we don\u2019t really wish to avoid you, because you are offering us a great channel for distributing our content. We want to reach out with our journalism.\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/32183194-b955-4167-98b9-a598c510e45e?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<center><sup>Aftenposten's print front page Friday.</sup></center>\n</div>\n\nHowever, even though I am editor-in-chief of Norway\u2019s largest newspaper, I have to realize that you are restricting my room for exercising my editorial responsibility. This is what you and your subordinates are doing in this case.\n\nI think you are abusing your power, and I find it hard to believe that you have thought it through thoroughly.\n\nLet me return to the picture I mentioned by Nick Ut. The napalm-girl is by far the most iconic documentary photography from the Vietnam war. The media played a decisive role in reporting different stories about the war than the men in charge wanted them to publish. They brought about a change of attitude which played a role in ending the war. They contributed to a more open, more critical debate. This is how a democracy must function.\n\nThe free and independent media have an important task in bringing information, even including pictures, which sometimes may be unpleasant, and which the ruling elite and maybe even ordinary citizens cannot bear to see or hear, but which might be important precisely for that reason.\n\n\u00abIf liberty means anything at all, British George Orwell wrote in the preface to Animal Farm, \u00abit means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\u00bb\n\nThe media have a responsibility to consider publication in every single case. This may be a heavy responsibility. Each editor must weigh the pros and cons.\n\nThis right and duty, which all editors in the world have, should not be undermined by algorithms encoded in your office in California.\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/bf0bf779-a539-44ca-922f-939dc7b5e183?fit=crop&q=80&w=780)\n<center><sup>The original post on Aftenposten's Facebook page.</sup></center>\n</div>\n\nMark, please try to envision a new war where children will be the victims of barrel bombs or nerve gas. Would you once again intercept the documentation of cruelties, just because a tiny minority might possibly be offended by images of naked children, or because a paedophile person somewhere might see the picture as pornography?\n\nFacebook\u2019s Mission Statement states that your objective is to \u201cmake the world more open and connected\u201d.\n\nIn reality you are doing this in a totally superficial sense.\n\nIf you will not distinguish between child pornography and documentary photographs from a war, this will simply promote stupidity and fail to bring human beings closer to each other.\n\nTo pretend that it is possible to create common, global rules for what may and what may not be published, only throws dust into peoples\u2019 eyes.\n\nThe last decade has shown the extent to which unpredicatable and destructive things can happen when publication refuses to take into account the context.\n\nThe controversy over the Mohammad-caricatures, which flared in late 2005 and still remains a heated debate, had unknown consequences simply because the context and the original justification for publication were ignored.\n\nThe drawings were put into entirely new contexts, censured and condemned based on allegedly universal religious rules. This resulted in large demonstrations, violence and killings \u2013 and a remaining, potent threat against the freedom of speech. Some of the persons involved must still live with police protection.\n\nFacebook did not go global until this controversy had passed its peak. Your approach, Mark, might possibly have been to ban publication of Mohammad-drawings? If so, Facebook would in a stereotype way have stood on the side of the extreme religious forces, in opposition to the freedom of speech. You would have overruled the individual editor\u2019s assessment. Those of us who were in the centre of events at the time had to weigh the pros and cons day by day \u2013 and make decisions based on the reality we were in.\n\n![](http://ap.mnocdn.no/images/7c28467a-625c-4487-be16-a70f64e68247?fit=crop&q=80&w=2048)\n<sup>This is the message Aftenposten received from Facebook.</sup>\n\nIt was \u2013 and remains \u2013 different in Oslo and Karachi.\n\nThe controversy over the caricatures demonstrates just how impossible and illogical it is, trying to live with universal rules for publication in a time which is multi-religious, muli-cultural and multi-everything. Every human practice differs a lot as to geography, politics, social and economic conditions.\n\nThe least Facebook should do in order to be in harmony with its time is introduce geographically differentiated guidelines and rules for publication. Furthermore, Facebook should distinguish between editors and other Facebook-users. Editors cannot live with you, Mark, as a master editor.\n\nThese measures would still only soften the problems. If Facebook has other objectives than just being as big as possible and earn as much money as possible \u2013 and this I am still convinced that you have, Mark \u2013 you should undertake a comprehensive review of the way you operate.\n\nYou are a nice channel for persons who wish to share music videos, family dinners and other experiences. On this level you are bringing people closer to each other. But if you wish to increase the real understanding between human beings, you have to offer more liberty in order to meet the entire width of cultural expressions and discuss substantial matters.\n\nAnd then you have to be more accessible. Today, if it is possible at all to get in touch with a Facebook representative, the best one may hope for are brief, formalistic answers, with rigid references to universal rules and guidelines. If you take the liberty to challenge Facebook\u2019s rules, you will be met \u2013 as we have seen \u2013 with censorship. And if someone will protest against the censorship, he will be punished, as Tom Egeland was.\n\nI could have continued, Mark, but I have to stop at this point. I have written this letter to you because I am worried that the world\u2019s most important medium is limiting freedom in stead of trying to extend it, and that this occasionally happens in an authoritarian way. But I am also writing \u2013 and I hope you will understand this \u2013 because I take a positive attitude to the possibilities that Facebook has opened up. I only hope that you will utilize the possibilities in a better way.\n\nSincerely yours Espen Egil Hansen Editor-in-chief and CEO Aftenposten\n\nPS. I enclose a commentary from Aftenposten\u2019s 73 year old cartoonist Inge Gr\u00f8dum to the censorship practiced by Facebook. What does the algorithm say? Would it pass?",

Model is Rachelle Summers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/487e1d3949.jpeg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://i.imgsafe.org/48875807ad.jpeg\" width=\"350\" height=\"525\"/></p>\n<p>This is \"Daydream\" from my <a href=\"https://steemit.com/art/@thecryptofiend/daydream-another-photo-post\">2nd post</a> (w. Rachelle Summers) and \"Oh the Horror!\" from <a href=\"https://steemit.com/photography/@thecryptofiend/oh-the-horror-the-nostalgia-of-1980s-horror-movies-and-my-homage-to-them\">a post </a>a few days later (w.

    "body": "<html>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK there is an architectural oddity in the form of a large statue perched on one of the walls of the civic centre building. &nbsp;I have yet to find out what it represents but have heard people referring to it as \"Spiderman\" due to the way the figure is \"sitting\" on the wall. &nbsp;I suspect it probably represents some character from classical (Greco-Roman) mythology.</p>\n<p>These photos show a lot of detail and were taken using my IR converted Canon EOS 450D with EFS 18-200mm lens. &nbsp;In this case the IR shows certain details that would otherwise not be apparent in regular wavelengths of light.</p>\n<p>It gives it a a very high contrast \"graphic novel\" feel to the images which I feel is fitting. &nbsp;Unfortunately due to the position of the statue relative to the building I was limited in the different views and angles I could get of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_013of5941bd.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_012of504160.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_01b1of1be4f1.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_014of5f221b.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/06/Arif_Akhtar_Statue_CC_015of500c4b.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1200\"/></p>\n<p>On some of the closer images you can see that the statue has no face. &nbsp;There is hair but the front part of the head &nbsp;is missing. &nbsp;Perhaps this is a clue to the identity?</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas please let me know. &nbsp;I hope you like the photos.</p>\n<p>If you like my work please follow me and check out my previous photography work and tutorials &nbsp;@thecryptofiend - hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Technical Information:</h1>\n<p>Canon EOS 450D with IR conversion</p>\n<p>Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens</p>\n<p>Adobe Lightroom CC and Nik Silver Effex Pro for processing.</p>\n<p>(Verification for me here: <a href=\"http://www.aapicture.com/about-me\">http://www.aapicture.com/about-me</a>)</p>\n</html>",

height=\"424\"/></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p><em><strong>On the 11th of January 2013, </strong></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\"><em><strong>Aaron Swartz</strong></em></a><em><strong>, a 26 year old internet activist was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment. &nbsp;He had been arrested 2 years earlier and was facing a variety of charges relating to downloading a large number of academic journal articles from an MIT server with the aim of making them available online for free.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Swartz was facing up to 50 years in prison on what seemed to be an extreme over-reaction to the actions of a young man who was trying to further the cause of the open access movement. &nbsp;It seems the stress of the situation and the aggression of the prosecution of this case caused the young man to take his own life.</p>\n<h3>This was all for the idealism of wanting open access to academic information much of which is publicly funded. &nbsp;He wanted a better world where scientific progress would not be hindered by the vested interests of publishing companies and unfortunately he payed for this \"great crime\" with his life.</h3>\n<p>Similar to what Swartz was attempting, Sci-Hub is an online archive in Russia that shares research articles from many journals freely. &nbsp;It currently hosts over 48 million articles and is being sued by publishing giant Elsevier for copyright infringement. &nbsp;Due to it's location it has been sheltered from the kind of legal sanctions it would face if it were located in the west. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final outcome of the legal action against them is anyone's guess but it is likely that the full force of the US government will be used to try to stop them, much in the way it was used against Swartz.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anyone who dares to challenge the vested interests in this case is likely to have war declared against them by nation states who are more concerned about protecting these interests than their own public or indeed the use of their own funds.</strong></em></p>\n<p>In this case it was the US government but most other Western governments would do exactly the same.</p>\n<h3>Copyright infringement is seemingly one of the worst crimes you can commit. &nbsp;The fact that much of this material was created using public money doesn't seem to matter to those that pursue the infringers.</h3>\n<p>In the rest of this article I hope to briefly cover why I feel that this is basically a form of war on Science and scientific progress itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Current Situation is a \"Racket\"</h1>\n<h1><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/33-1243179569caiVd09e6.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"/></h1>\n<p>2</p>\n<h1><em><strong>Three and a half years after Swartz' death we are still in a situation where the vast majority of scientific research is held captive behind pay walls. &nbsp;This is doubly scandalous given that a significant quantity of this research is publicly funded. &nbsp;</strong></em></h1>\n<p>The US alone spent about $158 billion on publicly funded research in 2013. &nbsp;The vast majority of this research was published in journals that require payment to be viewed.</p>\n<h3>Even if one doesn't believe that all research should be freely available why should research that is funded by the public be closed and require payment to be reviewed? &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>This is equivalent to making the public pay twice for the same research. &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><em>All the funds from payment go entirely to the journals. &nbsp;</em></h3>\n<p>None of it goes towards the researchers, authors or back to the public to fund further research. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The journals are effectively being given free material to publish which they then monetise purely for their own gain. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>They hold the copyright to all their published articles despite not being the original authors of them.</p>\n<h3>In what other situation can someone profit from selling and copyrighting a product which is made and tested almost entirely by others including the public itself?</h3>\n<p>It is complete insanity and it must stop.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Journals Have Costs But The Costs Are Inflated</h1>\n<p>Nobody is denying that the journals have costs but there are some misconceptions that relate to this. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Firstly the actual peer review process is carried out for free by academics (usually affiliated with Universities).&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The journals themselves are only responsible for the costs of filtering submissions and the actual publication itself. &nbsp;These are known as APCs (Article Processing Charges). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>When paid journals have been compared in price to open journals the APCs an be as much as 3 times higher. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Further a large chunk of these costs comes from the physical publication process something which does not apply to online publication.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Scientific Method Depends on Openness</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/The_Scientific_Method_as_an_Ongoing_Process.svg8b9c6.png\" width=\"728\" height=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<h3>I won't bore you all by going into the details of the scientific method. &nbsp;The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\">wikipedia article </a>here covers it quite well and the image above (by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:ArchonMagnus\">ArchonMagnus</a>) taken from it provides a nice summary of the basics. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>The \"other components section\" in the second part of the article is important here and I have summarised the headings here as they are pretty self-explanatory:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><em><strong>Replication</strong></em></li>\n  <li><em><strong>External review</strong></em></li>\n  <li><em><strong>Data recording and sharing\"</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of the above components are necessary for real scientific progress. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We need replication to show that research findings are not spurious. &nbsp;External review is necessary to look for and exclude sources of error or poor research technique that the authors may have missed. &nbsp;Data recording and sharing is necessary for the same reason so that others can look at the raw data and perform their own analysis, looking for statistical anomalies etc.</p>\n<h3>This is all vital for the sustained and healthy progress of all scientific fields. &nbsp;Information must be open for true scientific progress to occur.</h3>\n<p>This lack of openness also leads to a slowing down of the scientific process. &nbsp;Papers are often delayed for months due to errors and rewrites. &nbsp;Many of these could be more quickly identified if papers are published in preliminary form online as pioneered by ArXiv.</p>\n<h3>The TLDR is that fighting open research is akin to declaring war on the scientific method itself. &nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>The result is a system which is slower, has more flaws and potentially even shuts down certain potential avenues of advancement.</h3>\n<h3><em>Whatever the journal publishers may say : &nbsp;</em><em><strong>paywalls = censorship</strong></em><em>.</em></h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>Grey Research and Another Type of Censorship</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/iStock_64854985_SMALL46da6.jpg\" width=\"759\" height=\"632\"/></p>\n<p>4</p>\n<h3>Further there is a lot of unpublished \"grey research\" - these are papers that have no findings or have negative findings. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This kind of research is not considered \"sexy\" enough to be published by the major journals but from a purely scientific perspective it is just as important as the kind of studies that make headlines.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>This is a kind of soft censorship.&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>At University I was shocked to see quite how much medical research in particular was consigned to archives where it would not see the light of day because it was not considered to be publishable. &nbsp;Not due to being improper research but because of just this sort of issue. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The failure to consider these kinds of studies leads to a significant skewing effect on the positive findings of those studies that do get published. &nbsp;The ultimate effect is that we do not get the big picture. &nbsp;This is particularly of concern in medical research where we only really see overtly positive studies.</h3>\n<p>Some research is also deliberately \"shelved\" if it doesn't agree with the agenda of one or more of the funding organisations. &nbsp;We have seen multiple scandals in relation to drug companies trying to hide certain research related to lucrative drugs as and side effects or adverse outcomes in the last couple of decades. &nbsp;Antidepressants and suicide risk is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/14/antidepressants-can-raise-the-risk-of-suicide-biggest-ever-revie/\">just one recent example</a>.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to say how many people may have died or been seriously harmed as a result of these kind of actions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>This is not a new thing and is more akin to a deliberate hard censorship. </strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>This is one of the reasons why I believe all research particularly that with public safety/health implications should be made public.</h3>\n<hr />\n<h1>Even Large Universities Can't Afford Access</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/Widener_Library_Harvard_University_Cambridge_MA6978c.jpg\" width=\"640\"

the journals which it had previously. &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>They cited multiple increases in journal prices in the preceeding years as the reason. &nbsp;The vast majority of journals are owned by 3 major publishers who offer them in bundles - much like cable TV packages. &nbsp;Universities must negotiate prices for bundles and there is no set price. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The vast monopolies created by these companies mean that there is little competition to lower prices.</h3>\n<p>Prices have continued to increase despite the fact that the internet has substantially lowered the costs of publishing and disseminating information. &nbsp;From 1984 to 2002 alone the cost increased by 600%.</p>\n<h3>This is particularly ridiculous when some of the research that the Universities must pay for is research they themselves conducted!</h3>\n<p>If large Universities can't afford this then there is no way that smaller institutions or indeed individual scientists or members of the public can afford to.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>What is Open Access?</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/08/open-book-1378562978Vki3650a.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\"/></p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>There are a number of slightly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access\">different definitions</a> but the basic thrust of it is contained in this excerpt from the Budapest Open Access Initiative in February 2002 relating to online access to academic journal articles:</p>\n<h3><em>\"There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature. By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.\"</em></h3>\n<p>This is what Swartz and many others in the open access community have been trying to achieve. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sadly it seems the main thing holding open access back is&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The \"culture\" within the scientific community which falsely believes that paid journals are a necessity.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>The vast lobbying power that the large consolidated multi-billion dollar publishing companies that own the big journals have which allows them to manipulate governments.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1>Can Blockchains Help?</h1>\n<p>I am not a programmer or coder so I must apologise if I am incorrect in my understanding here. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>If a platform like Steemit can place large amounts of articles on a blockchain then I don't see why something similar could not be done for scientific research.</h3>\n<h3>The decentralised nature of a blockchain would prevent censorship by vested interests (publishers, drug companies etc.). &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If a culture could be created where all research was placed on an academic blockchain like this as a basic prerequisite then both issues of access and lost research could be substantially reduced.</p>\n<p>As long as the blockchain remained in existence so would the research and all the associated data. &nbsp;Grey or hidden research could potentially be made a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>Anyone could access any research data anywhere in the world. &nbsp;It would require a lot of work and a lot of cultural change but I believe it to be feasible.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Some Signs of Hope</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/31/iStock_76511897_SMALL42a71.jpg\" width=\"848\" height=\"565\"/></p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p>There do appear to be some signs of change. &nbsp;Organisations such as PLoS (<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmlq-bpYDPAhWFCMAKHdbbD8oQFggeMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plos.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHD3YE-emOnoKJ8zjKDZ7ANvWFlIw&amp;sig2=a7_T5eyYCS8dC4UNNabgSw\">Public Library of Science</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PubMed_Central\">PubMed Central</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwignZCEqIDPAhVlLMAKHV7ZB8gQFggzMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArXiv&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtJ0miuq3iMwen_obEMJQsE-4XUw&amp;sig2=MMLyMay5noGlB6c7w6BbYA&amp;bvm=bv.131783435,d.ZGg\">ArXiv</a> have embraced the open access ethos. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>PLOS has a \"no questions asked\" waver for APCs to remove any financial barriers to publication. &nbsp;Some open access journals don't charge any fees at all.</p>\n<p>Governments have also tried to embrace change to some degree. &nbsp;For example the US National Institute for Health (NIH) which accounts for 50% of government funding aims to make all research which it funds publicly available within a year. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The major publishers had asked for a longer embargo so whilst the delay is not ideal it can be seen as a victory of sorts if a mixed one at that.</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Edit: @lemouth has also made me aware of the following iniative in the comments (his words):</strong></em></p>\n<p>\"First, about the <a href=\"https://scoap3.org/\">SCOAP3 initiative</a>.

Right now, if you are not upvoted by a \u201cwhale\u201d account, it is very difficult to get exposure and any substantial rewards, which leads to many great authors leaving Steemit.</p>\n<p>Robin Hood wants to be the \u201cwhale\u201d that finds and helps a diverse set of talented, yet unrecognized authors. The proposed way of doing this is to cycle between different authors, upvoting ~10-20 quality posts daily. RHW won't upvote the same authors twice in any 10-day period in an effort to support more people and discourage any kind of abuse or ulterior motives.</p>\n<p>For RHW to have any meaningful impact, it must reach whale-status of SP and/or many bot followers. Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg for this initiative. As featured authors and posts will be publicly announced periodically, we hope to inspire a movement that will lead &nbsp;to authors gaining fans, following and eventually to be able to self-sustain a blog on SteemIT without the RHW help at all.</p>\n<p>In a way, RHW's ultimate goal would be to not be needed at all. But as new enthusiastic authors join, RHW will be here to find them, help them and upvote them, growing the community and the overall quality of what you can find on Steemit.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/iu8Uf8b.png</p>\n<h2>Curators</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a total of 10 official curators with a waiting list of other fellow Steemians. Curators are well known SteemIT individuals that dig through the vast amount of content to find hidden gems and undervalued authors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We would like to keep the curators list private for the time being, so they can continue working without interruptions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Curators can publicly state they are part of Robin Hood at their sole discretion.*</p>\n<h2>Curation Process</h2>\n<p>Each curator discovers interesting content, including, but not limited to, the new section, steemviz, steemd, promotional channels on Steemit.chat and robinhood-links channel.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The author name is checked to ensure it\u2019s out of the 10-day cycle&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The post is digested</li>\n  <li>The post is checked for plagiarism (with online tools and google)</li>\n  <li>The post is checked for Image sources and/or mention of own work</li>\n  <li>The images are run through online tools for reverse image search (if own work is mentioned)</li>\n  <li>If everything stated above is in check the link is submitted to the curator private chat</li>\n  <li>Other curators chime in if they agree or disagree and why</li>\n  <li>If agreed upon the post is upvoted by RHW, mentioned in general chat and listed in the official spreadsheet</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What's In It For Me?</p>\n<p>The more we elevate varied authors the larger the economy of Steemit gets. This benefits everyone since more members will have incentive to stick around. Satisfied members invite more friends if they themselves are successful. As an investor you get a percentage of your total contribution back as Steem each month.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>http://i.imgur.com/HGkOE5P.png</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Who Will Control The Keys?</h2>\n<p>A multi-signature system is currently being developed to add security and reassure investors that their funds are safe. The system will require two curators to sign off on an upvote, and more team members to agree on more sensitive actions.</p>\n<p>Currently the master key is held by @repholder, the backup master key by @kyriacos and the active key has been added to Streemian (owner - @xeroc).</p>\n<h2>Alpha Testing Results</h2>\n<p>Sample Dates : 20/08-28/08</p>\n<p>Sample Size : 78 Unique Authors&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Average payout : $134.48</p>\n<p>Issues Found: 2 - ID Theft/Plagiarism (which was unvoted) and a manual upvote mistake</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UkN21t27uG9Fo_vRjX8lKasXOU0xIEL4AviCvlMMNw/edit#gid=0\">Spreadsheet of Alpha Testing Featured Authors</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.com/@laonie\">Updates for users that are censored from Google services</a></p>\n<h2>How Can I Take Part ?</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Help find great authors and provide a link to their posts in #robinhood-links.</li>\n  <li>Connect to <a href=\"https://streemian.com/\">Streemian</a> and join the robinhoodwhale trail ( for invite codes contact @instructor2121 on steemit.chat). <em>Note:</em> Streemian uses the active key.</li>\n  <li>Use @lukestokes <a href=\"https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@lukestokes/trusting-the-hive-mind-building-my-own-voting-bot-for-robinhoodwhale\">advanced bot guide</a>&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Provide your posting key to @laonie to add to his own RHW bot follower or use his <a href=\"https://steemit.com/robinhoodwhale/@laonie/how-to-set-up-your-own-voting-bot-for-robinhoodwhale\">setup voting bot guide</a></li>\n  <li>Invest in RHW by sending Steem, SD or Steem power to @robinhoodwhale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steemit.chat Channels</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood\">robinhood</a> - General discussion about the Robin Hood Whale initiative&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steemit.chat/channel/robinhood-links\">robinhood-links</a> - These are posts to be considered by curators of the Robin Hood Whale initiative.

There are many different ways to implement this system. I feel like I need more collaboration with developers and the business to fully understand the technical constraints and business objectives. As @jesta said in his [post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal) yesterday:\n> TLDR: This project, done right, really isn't as simple as it sounds.\n\nAnyway, for now, the most valuable thing I can do to contribute is to post some lower fidelity (not polished) mobile web designs that outline my proposed Information Architecture (IA) and User Experience (UX). Once we can agree on the right content and feature set for the MVP version of Bounties, I'd like to polish the visual design and create desktop designs.\n\n## Assumptions and mechanics\nI agree with most of the mechanics outlined by @jesta in his [Steemit Bounty System proposal](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal). If you haven't read it, please check it out. There are a few things that I want to challenge though:\n\n1. I think that the Bounty system should live within steemit.com (and not on a separate domain). There are pros and cons of this approach but I think keeping bounties native to the steemit.com ecosystem will create the most long term value due to it's ease of use for most non-advanced users. \n  \u2013 I propose that it lives at: http://steemit.com/bounties\n  \u2013 In case bounties are required to live on a separate domain for technical or legal reasons, perhaps it could live on the http://bounties.steemit.com subdomain. \n\n2. I'm leaning towards requiring bounty creators to be registered and logged into Steemit.com to post a new bounty.     \n\u2013 This would make posting a new bounty very similar to posting a new blog post. \n\u2013 It would also enable people to fund bounties using a similar mechanism to 'Promote a post' (instead of transferring funds to @bounty via steempay.io/shapeshift/cli_wallet commands as proposed by @jesta.\n\u2013 Requiring registration for bounty creators should increase the overall quality and reduce the potential for bounty abuse and misuse by increasing accountability and Steemit reputation transparency (like that outlined by @mrosenquist [here](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal#@mrosenquist/re-jesta-steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal-20160913t041449326z)) \n\n## Design ethos\n\nSince these designs are intended to live on Steemit.com, I've tried to adhere to Steemit's visual styles and retain it's interaction patterns for similar tasks. For example:\n  \u2013 Creating a bounty should be as easy and as similar as posting a blog post. \n  \u2013 Funding a bounty should be as easy and as similar as promoting a blog post. \n\n# Competitor analysis\n\nTo kick off the design process, I reviewed several comparable website earlier this week. Check it out here: \n\n[https://steemit.com/bounties/@pkattera/competitor-analysis-for-ned-s-proposed-bounty-management-system](https://steemit.com/bounties/@pkattera/competitor-analysis-for-ned-s-proposed-bounty-management-system)\n\n# Information Architecture \n\nHere's my proposed structure for the Bounties website:\n\n![Information-ArchitectureCopy2f439.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Information-ArchitectureCopy2f439.jpg)\n\nAlthough I'd love to include a Bounty Hunter leaderboard and user profiles, I think we should keep the MVP as simple as possible for now and include it in a future version. \n\n# Content and features\n\nNow that I've outline the page templates and structure above, the Content Hierarchy diagram below shows a high level view of content and features to be included on each page. \n\n![Content77511.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Content77511.jpg)\n\n# Mobile UX designs\n\nBelow are the mobile designs. Note: All copy, images and icons are placeholder for now.\n\n<br>\n## Bounties home / landing page\n\n![1.Bounty-home-page3de51.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/1.Bounty-home-page3de51.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Post a bounty (excluding milestones)\n\nAs per my previous post, adding milestones to bounties increases the complexity of the whole bounty system. \n> My gut feeling is to keep it super simple for version 1 and exclude milestones. People could still create individual bounties for separate tasks and link related bounties within the description.\n\nThis design excludes the concept of milestones. \n\n![2.Post-a-bounty4b820.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/2.Post-a-bounty4b820.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Post a bounty (including milestones)\n\nBut if people feel strongly about keeping milestones, here is a design. \n\n![Milestones78f61.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/Milestones78f61.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Bounty template\n\n![3a.Bounty-template-brief1aec2.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/3a.Bounty-template-brief1aec2.jpg)\n\n![3b.Bounty-template-submissions05700.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/3b.Bounty-template-submissions05700.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Submission template\n\n![4a-Submission6c0f1.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/4a-Submission6c0f1.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Submit work\n\n![4b.Submit-a-post81120.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/4b.Submit-a-post81120.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## My bounties\n\nA place to keep track of all the bounties that you've posted, entered, or watched.\n\n![5.My-bountiesf7ffb.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/5.My-bountiesf7ffb.jpg)\n\n<br>\n## Filters on the bounty home / landing page\n\n![1a.filtersf0c90.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/09/14/1a.filtersf0c90.jpg)\n\n\n<br>\n---\n#### Questions or concerns?\n\nMessage me on steemit.chat (pkattera)\n\n<br>\n#### Thank you\n\nA few people to thank for inspiring me to design the Bounty System:\n\n\u2013 @ned for kicking off this initiative \n\u2013 @jesta for [this post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@jesta/steem-bounty-system-milestone-1-proposal)\n\u2013 @steve-walschot for [this post](https://steemit.com/bounty/@steve-walschot/application-for-bounty-system-by-ned)\n\u2013 @blueorgy for image hosting ([SteemIMG](https://www.steemimg.com/) gets better and better!) \n\n<br>\n#### Acknowledgements \n\nI used a few icons from The [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

    "body": "# Life is unfair.. and it's okay.\n\nSome people will have better luck and fortune than others. Nothing will ever stop that. Life is unfair. - **We all know it**. However, people also tend to discuss the fairness of steemit. - I've done it myself too so I know what I'm talking about.\n\n<center>http://cdn.h3sean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Unfair.png</center>\n<center>[Source](http://h3sean.com/god-unfair/)</center>\n\n> *\"Steemit is unfair.\"*\n\nBut.. Is it really unfair? - **I don't know. Perhaps. Probably.**\n\nHave you ever gambled on a casino? In real life or online doesn't matter.\n\n**- I bet some of you've done that.**\n\nHave you ever played a computer game, a card game or have you ever played monopoly with your family, friends or against other people?\n\n**- I bet most of you have done that.**\n\n<center>http://blogs.lasprovincias.es/elsindromededarrin/files/2016/07/o-MONOPOLY-facebook-1.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://blogs.lasprovincias.es/elsindromededarrin/)</center>\n\n### The follow-up questions are..\n- Did you win? - Did you win every single time you played? - Are you the best there is at the game?\n\nI bet most of you would love to answer **yes** on these questions but in reality, most of you would lie if you did that. - You didn't win everytime and you're probably not the best player ever at these games. - **Is that unfair?**\n\n- It's life. It's bound to happen. You'll never be able to win everytime you play a game against others. At some point you'll meet someone who's better than you. A person with more skills. A person with more knowledge, experience or a person who've trained more than you. A person with more luck.\n\nYou will lose that game.. **And that's okay.**\n\n---\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/bYmdHcX.gif</center>\n<center>[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1ubutj/the_power_of_mike_tyson_in_his_prime/)</center>\n\n### With that being said..\nIf I tried to fight Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali, in the past, during their glory days.. I would probably end up dead. I don't have the fighting skills it takes to bring down such monstrous beasts.\n\nSo.. **How can I expect to get a ton of rewards on Steemit with every single post of mine?** - It's impossible.. Or is it..?\n\nWhat you count as *\"a ton of reward\"* would obviously play a major role in this so let's say anything between $100 and $300+. That would be 1 or 2 whales. On each post. **Roughly estimated.**\n\nI've told you this before. I had never owned a bitcoin before I joined steemit. I don't consider myself to be *\"the lucky guy\"*, but I'm not unlucky either. **I believe I deserve what I've made so far.**\n\nI share content, I try to promote steemit and I try to help others and all that.. I contribute. More on that later in this post.\n\n---\n\n<center>http://www.worldmomsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ID-10086141.jpg</center>\n<center>[source](http://www.worldmomsnetwork.com/2013/10/30/egypt-can-life/)</center>\n\nAnyhow, I never owned a bitcoin before I joined steemit... **So I wouldn't call myself a bitcoin expert would I?** - Especially since there's thousands of other people here with more knowledge than me. People who are true experts. I leave that subject where it is. **In the hands of the real experts**. In the hands of people who understand what it's all about. People who know every single detail about it.\n\n### So, what can I do? - And what should I post?\n\nFirst of all, I would give myself some time and think about this entire community we have here. What can I do for steemit? - What can I do for you? - **What can I bring to the table?**\n\nDo I have something that others lack? - Am I better at something than others..?\n\n- **In my case I would say no**. I never compare myself with others like that. I find it stupid.. And I would probably only hurt myself if I did.\n\n## Why do I even mention this then..?\n\n<center>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y0CGvDsBGMI/UszG2RE2SkI/AAAAAAAACWk/_5DP51zVdwM/s1600/standinginyourway.png</center>\n<center>[Source](http://quotesgram.com/your-own-worst-enemy-quotes/)</center>\n\n- Because **time** and **thoughts** is what will give you an upper hand. **An upper hand against yourself.**\n\nYou are your biggest hinder. On steemit and in life. You are the one standing in front of the treasure but you lack the courage to grab it. I've been there too and it's okay. - **As long as you are aware of it.**\n\nYou are your own enemy so don't spend time comparing yourself with others.. **Don't get more enemies.**\n\n---\n\n## Moving on..\n\nYou should always publish content you want to share. Things you believe in, things you like. What you truly want to share. Not what you think others would like. That's a pretty common sentence these days. I've said it myself too a bunch of times already.. **So why do I bring it up once more?**\n\nI don't know you in person. I don't know what type of person you are or what you can or cannot do.. But I do know that there's an endless ocean of people out there (perhaps not on steemit alone) who doesn't know what to write.. Even though they know that they should publish content they like to share!\n\n**And why is that?**\n\n- The main reason for this is that some people aren't aware of the things they are good at.\n\nThey know but they would never answer a question with that.\n\n---\n\n### I'll give you an example of this:\n\nImagine a job interview. Some people are nervous so they shake and others are filled with confidence.\n\n<center>http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1937498/original.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/30/hunger-entitlement-study_n_5631594.html)</center>\n\nSuddenly the question comes..\n\n- **What are your qualities as a person?**\n\nor\n\n- **Why should we hire you instead of someone else?**\n\nAny of these two questions means instant death to some people. **They don't know how to answer that.**\n\nThey know that they are a great parent, amazing artists or very skilled football players.. But they don't mention that during the interview or as answers for these questions because it doesn't *\"fit\"*.\n\nThe job is for a grocery store or as a salesperson, literally anything that doesn't *\"fit\"* your category.. So to be a great football player or a good artist doesn't count.. Right? - **Wrong.**\n\n<center>http://cyrusevanado.s3.amazonaws.com/ai/selfmarketing/images/shoppingdude.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://cyrusevanado.s3.amazonaws.com/ai/selfmarketing/index.html)</center>\n\n## A great answer is more important than \"the answer\".\n\nWhat do I mean by that? - **Take a look at this:**\n\n- **What are your qualities as a person?**\n\n> *\"I am a humble person with a burning desire to build a family, raising two beautiful kids, driving a SUV and take my kids to Disneyland. I would love to see my kids with that super-smile on their face when they hug Mickey Mouse. That's who I am. Do you have kids?\"*\n\n- **Why should we hire you instead of someone else?**\n\n> *\"I've always loved to share my creations as an artist with the people around me. I'm hardworking and I've been freelancing full time for 5 years now.\"*\n\n**Now your face probably looks like this:**\n\n<center>https://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/What+face+_78d9aaf81a6f9b7902ca1ee371b90428.png</center>\n<center>[Source](https://funnyjunk.com/channel/feels/We+all+know+that+feel/XsvvGKf/6)</center>\n\nAnd yeah, I can understand why.. This was confusing for me too when I first encountered this.. But let me break this down for you even further..\n\n**What did I accomplish with these answers? - None of them are actually *\"related\"* to the questions, right?**\n\n- **In the first answer I actually tell them this:**\n\n> I am humble person, a good listener and I'm willing to help others.. I am a dreamer and I will work hard to get there. I will bring my A game at all times.\n\n- That's not at all the things I said, but that's how most people will interpret it. Having a family, raising kids and having dreams about vacations, smiles and a SUV. **That speaks for itself.** That means you're willing to push yourself to get there. You also touch their hearts with this. You go deep. You go to a personal level.\n\n**In my second answer, I tell them this:**\n\n> I care about others. I help others and I feel good about it. I work hard no matter what's at stake and I always deliver. I've delivered for 5 years already and I won't stop now.\n\n- Again, this isn't near the things I said.. But between the lines, this is a perfect match of what I gave as an answer. You share your creations which basically means that you care about others and that's important no matter what you'll work with. You've also been working full time for the past 5 years, so you are filled with confidence, know-how and you're still alive.. **So that means that you know what you're doing.**\n\n---\n\n### Most people would answer these questions like this:\n\n> My name is ______ and I'm ___ years old. I live ______ and I'm interested in this job. I previously worked at ________. I am honest, loyal and trustworthy. I am a nice person if you asked my friends.\n\nAnd sure, this isn't bad.. But it's the same type of answer they got a billion times before.. - Hopefully, you understand my point with this. - Use your talents. Think about it. **You have much more than you are able to see!**\n\n<center>http://img12.deviantart.net/62ed/i/2011/140/d/6/be_you_wallpaper__grey_by_lileviljess-d3gs5ts.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://lileviljess.deviantart.com/art/Be-You-Wallpaper-Grey-209586304)</center>\n\n---\n\nShare what you are. Share the things you are good at. Share things you've done and things you do.. **Be you.** - That's what will bring you the most rewards in the long run. Especially on a personal level.\n\n<center>**Be the best you can be.**</center>\n\n---\n\n### What do I do..?\n\nI share things I care about. I share things from my personal life. I share things I feel good about.\n\nI also share *\"Hidden Photography Gems\"*. - None of them have reached high rewards.. I've also just recently launched a special contest. A \"secret contest\" and I've even sent the winner the prize money. I earned 1.8 STEEM POWER and lost $27 SBD in total doing that.. - **And I'm truly glad I did what I did.**\n\nI do this to help others. I do this to bring value, faith and happiness to steemit. It's not much but it's something. Hopefully I can encourage people. I can't change a person's life with my votes or with $27 SBD but I can make a huge difference with my words. I can spread the word as much as possible and hopefully, at some point, someone will pick that up.. **And that's the chance we're looking for!** \n\n<center>**That's the chance I want to give to all of us.**</center>\n\nWhen I feature people's posts I always wish that they will receive comments and upvotes, I would love to see that. On each and everyone of the posts I feature.. I will continue to spread my word and publish authors from the photography section because I feel that the photography section deserves much more attention.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it will get more attention in a month or a year automatically when more users have joined steemit.. I want to be part of this. I want to spread the word. I want to help. - **And I will continue to do that.**\n\n<center>**I do this because I feel good about it .. And in return, I help you. In one way or another.**</center>\n\n<center>http://www.sirenconsultingfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/something-better-than-nothing.jpg</center>\n<center>[Source](http://www.sirenconsultingfirm.com/in-marketing-something-is-better-than-nothing/)</center>\n\n---\n\n<center>[**Feel Free To Follow Me**](https://steemit.com/@hitmeasap)</center>\n\n---",

    "body": "Some people are still confused as to what a witness is. There's a lot of mixed information on Steemit as to what a witness does, and how much they earn.\n\nI'm here to clear this up with a thorough post, with simple explanations where possible.\n\n## What is a witness?\n\n**A witness plays a crucial part in how the STEEM network functions. Some people might not be aware of this, but Steemit is just a fancy web interface on top of a large network called STEEM, which operates remotely similar to Bitcoin.**\n\nSimple Definition:\n\n>A STEEM witness is a person whom operates a **witness server** (which produces blocks), and publishes a price feed of STEEM/USD to the network.\n\nWitnesses have many tasks. **The first and foremost is to produce blocks (thus process transactions)**, the second most important is to produce a price feed, which is how STEEM Dollars are always worth 1 US Dollar in STEEM (using the 7 day exchange).\n\nYou may have heard of the term **51% attack** before. Unlike Bitcoin, miners don't matter much to the STEEM network, instead, that is a witnesses job: \n\n**A hard fork happens when 67% of the top witnesses are all running a certain version of STEEM**, which means the top 19 witnesses can pick and choose whether to agree with a fork or not. (e.g. Hard Fork 13 and 14 were both postponed for a week, and re-designed because witnesses refused to update)\n\nTl;Dr\n\n - They're the main producer of blocks (not miners)\n - They maintain a price feed, which is how SBD functions\n - They play the role of consensus (decide whether to hard fork or not)\n - Many witnesses, such as myself, @riverhead, @roadscape @jesta and @arhag work on important things to help the STEEM network function and grow\n - Some witnesses don't produce any content, or work on anything STEEM related, e.g. @gtg - however, they are sometimes highly focused witnesses, who are very reliable (gtg has only missed 2 blocks after running for months)\n\n## Why should I care?\n\nA witness is paid proportionally to how high they are in the witness ranks, excluding the top 19 witnesses (who get 1 block every ~63 seconds).\n\nBut how do they get to those ranks? **They get voted in, by people like YOU**. It's just like an election, **if you don't vote, other people may vote in witnesses who are malicious or simply unreliable.**\n\n@thecryptofiend has came up with a questionnaire for witnesses, which may help people decide on who to vote for: https://steemit.com/steemit/@thecryptofiend/witness-questionnaire-a-solution-for-voter-confusion\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ldf0VnV.png)\n<center>Witness voting page</center>\n\nYou can see the witness ranks, and vote for witnesses at https://steemit.com/~witnesses\n\n## How are blocks created/scheduled?\n\nIt's not a very even mixture as you would hope. Blocks are produced in \"rounds\", which are 21 blocks long, and blocks are created every 3 seconds.\n\nDuring each 21 block round, the blocks are distributed as such:\n\n - 19 blocks go to the top 19 voted witnesses (who are slightly shuffled to avoid witnesses purposely skipping blocks)\n - 1 block goes to a Proof-of-Work miner, who becomes a witness for just 1 block.\n - 1 semi-random witness outside of the top 19, which is influenced by their ranking\n\nYou can read more about the witness scheduling (it's very complicated!) in this article by Steemit CTO @dantheman :\n\nhttps://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/steem-witness-scheduling-algorithm\n\n## How often do they get blocks (how much do they earn)?\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, witnesses are paid proportional to their rank in the system. A witness at rank 30 can produce as many as 4 blocks/hour, compared to a witness at rank 50, which may produce less than 1 block/hour.\n\n**A STEEM block is worth 1 STEEM Power (not STEEM, or SBD), which means all rewards for miners/witnesses are trickle-paid for 2 years.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OaOiNlf.png)\n<center>[@someguy123 on SteemDB](https://steemdb.com/@someguy123)</center>\n\nIn my current position, 39, I create between 2 to 3 blocks per hour. `(2 * 24) * 31 = 1488` - that's approximately 1,500 STEEM Power per month at rank 39.\n\n### But what about the top 19? What do they get?\n\nThe top 19 witnesses get 1 block each, per 21 block round. This means they get approximately 1 block per 63 seconds.\n\nPer day they get roughly 1400 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24) / 63 = 1,371.42```\n\nPer month they get roughly 42,500 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24 * 31) / 63 = 42,514.28```\n\nAnd per year they get roughly 510,000 SP\n\n```(60 * 60 * 24 * 31 * 12) / 63 = 510,171.42```\n\n## Can anyone become a witness?\n\nThe short answer is: Yes.\n\nBecoming a witness requires several things:\n\n - A powerful (and reliable) server to run a witness server on\n - A second powerful server, with good bandwidth - to operate a Steem Seed (similar to a Bitcoin full node, distributes blocks)\n - Creating a **signing key**, and then broadcasting your intent to become a witness from `cli_wallet`\n - An accurate price feed of STEEM/USD which is updated *at least* once per day\n - Technical capabilities - you should understand most STEEM concepts, and be able to deal with server problems quickly\n - Trust from the community that you would be a good candidate for a witness\n\nSome of these steps are optional (e.g. the seed), while others might not matter until you approach the top 19 (the price feed) however, they're all very strongly recommended if you want to succeed as a witness.\n\n------\n\nI will be posting an in-depth tutorial on setting up a witness soon, as many of the existing articles lack important details. Until then, if you want to set up a witness, I recommend joining `#witness` on [STEEMIT.CHAT](https://steemit.chat) and asking for up to date guidance.\n\n------\n\n\n---\n\nDo you like what I'm doing for STEEM/Steemit?\n----\n[Vote for me to be a witness](https://steemit.com/~witnesses) - every vote counts. \n----\nDon't forget to follow me for more like this.\n----",

    "body": "After writing my first introduction post without pics and receiving $0.03, and then reposting my intro with picks which earned $18.29, it quickly cemented in my mind the importance of having pics in my posts on Steemit. But you see, for me to include images in my posts is many times more difficult than the average Steemian. \n\n## Because I\u2019m vision impaired and can\u2019t see any of the images!\n\nHowever, somehow it seemed to me that to have any kind of success on Steemit, there was a commonly accepted rule that your posts need to contain images; whether you\u2019re writing a novel, or a philosophical piece, *almost all the trending posts have images!*\n\n### So, for the past few weeks of my Steemit life, I\u2019ve been asking my wife to help me find suitable pics for my posts. \nBut this has become an extremely stressful process, because we have a two year old son, and my wife rarely has any time to rest during the day. Therefore she looks forward to the small amounts of time that she gets to rest and relax in the evening. You can imagine how annoying it is for her when I\u2019m constantly interrupting her relaxation time, requesting her to find pics for me on Steemit. Thankfully, I\u2019m blessed with a kind and generous wife. She loves me very much, and often tells me that she is happy to help me with whatever I need, especially with what I love doing. But I don\u2019t want to be relying on her all the time. \n\nLast night however, when like previous nights, I asked my wife for her help.  But this time around, it was following a very exhausting week for her when my son and I had both been sick, and she had just recently become pregnant with our second child. So she blew up at me and became upset when I had taken up more than 40 minutes of her chill time. \n\n## And by the way, that post we worked so hard on all day earned us less than $1. \nSo this morning, I resolved to start writing about the topics I truly care about. No more stressing out about posts, no more fussing over optimum times to post my articles, and no more needing to find images for each post. \n\n# I\u2019m going to start enjoying my time on Steemit.\n\n## O yes, again, do we really need images on each post?\n\nFor more posts without images, follow me @nextgen622\n\nJimmy\n\nPS. Thanks @deanliu for the recommendation to post more Chinese articles. I will definitely do more of them in the future.",
