A number of posts by a co-founder and @steemitblog has spurred widespread discussions on **Curation efforts and Voting patterns**.  Also, the issue of **\u201cID theft, harassment and plagiarism\u201d** was widely discussed. \nSteemMag in its usual manner reached out to a number of key Steemians who have in-depth knowledge of the issues and had chats with them\u2026. Really interesting chats\u2026. I had a great time getting everything ready.. I\u2019m sure you will enjoy it too.\nGet a cup of coffee and let\u2019s kick off the fun ride :)\n\n---\n**In page 1:**\nSteemMag had a chat with @riverhead \u2013 A whale who is also a witness and also the back-end moderator of Steemit.chat. A very nice guy I must say. We had a chat with him on topics ranging from how he joined Steemit, community participation and curation.  I\u2019m sure you would enjoy hearing from him. \n I also had a chat with @firepower- who is the front-end Lead Moderator of Steemit.chat\n\n**In Page 2:**\nSteemMag had a chat with @anyx , The Lead of the Steemcleaners project\nWe also reached out to a number of steemians for our weekly Steemians Speak  on an exciting topic that can bring some nostalgia. ;)\nAnd lots more\n---\n**SteemMag in Russian**\nIn addition to the ongoing translation of previous issues of SteemMag to chinese, @zaebars had the idea of translating previous issues of SteemMag and Official Steemit announcements to the Russian language. I believe this ongoing translation projects will help provide more language diversity on Steemit.... If you're interested in translating SteemMag to your native language. Please hit me on steemit.chat  @infovore for further discussions.\n\nP.S [Here is the link to the Russian translation of steemMag](https://steemit.com/ru/@rusteemitblog/steemmag-ezhenedelnyi-stimit-daidzhest-8-perevod-stati-infovore)  and [this](https://steemit.com/ru/@rusteemitblog/steemmag-ezhenedelnyi-stimit-daidzhest-8-2-perevod-stati-infovore)\n\n---\n\n<h2>A Chat With @riverhead</h2>\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/t0eh0af69/An_Exclusive_Interview_with__smooth.png\n\nSteemMag:\n**How did you get to know about steemit? And how has the journey been so far?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nA friend of mine, who was involved early on, called me to tell me about really cool new crypto project. This was back in early April and I really liked the idea. A decentralized Buzzreditbook \u2013 how cool is that? Finally a blockchain project that wasn't trying to reinvent the financial world!\n\nSo far I've been having a blast with Steem and also the Steemit UI. Like any other large project there are good days and bad but the good days far outnumber the bad! I'm constantly amazed at the great people involved with the project. A quick look at steemtools.com is all it takes to see the deep pool of talent in and around the project.\n\n\nSM:\n**You are also a back-end moderator of steemit.chat. What are those things you've noticed so far?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me as moderator is just how little it takes for one person to get a channel completely fired up and turned into a troll-box. Thankfully we have a great team of levelheaded moderators that are helping to keep the peace!\n\nI have also been blown away by the people, such as Firepower, that have recognized the value of steemit.chat and have stepped up to do what they can to see it grow. Firepower has some great ideas and brings a lot of energy and optimism to the steemit.chat platform. Exciting times ahead!\n\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**A number of Steemians complain of the platform not running as smooth as that of slack. What more functionality should Steemians look out for?**\n\nI completely agree with those that have noticed the relative sluggishness of Rocket Chat versus Slack. We have been scaling up server side hardware and software to try to address these issues. Slack and Rocket Chat provide similar services but are intended for different audiences. A few key differences to note:\n\n\u2013\tOn Slack we had around 1000 users compared to a little over 3000 on Rocket Chat.\n\n\u2013\tThe free Slack service has a global message history limit of 10000. With the volume of traffic we have now on Rocket Chat a message would only last a few seconds and Direct Messages just wouldn't be functional at all. To remove that limitation Slack charges $7 USD/account. Yes, $21,000 USD/month for a chat server at our current occupancy!\n\n\u2013\tSlack is designed for teams with external management structures and therefore does not have the depth of moderator tools we enjoy with Rocket Chat. There are almost no moderator controls at all in Slack. For Slack's intended audience this is fine but for a public community of this size it would be chaos. The most obvious omissions are channel specific moderators and the ability to assign commands based on account role (moderators can mute users for example).\n\n\u2013\tRocket Chat allows the community to own its own data and log files. The paid version of Slack has some of this functionality but a community is still more or less at the mercy of Slack's EULA.\n\n\u2013\tA specific example of a difference between a community owned service and a paid service: when a few Slack accounts were compromised and email/passwords changed there was a lengthy back and forth with Slack support which didn't really get anywhere. On Rocket Chat we could return the compromised accounts to their respective owners in a few minutes.\n\n\n\nSM:\n**As a whale, what do you look for in posts before voting?**\n\n@riverhead:\n**I've answered this question and gone back and deleted it about five times now. So let's try it again, this time with feeling.** The two biggest goals for my voting are to grow the platform and reward quality content creators. One thing to keep in mind is that as a large Steem Power holder my incentives lean much more toward long term success of the platform than rewards from curating.\n\nWhen I'm reviewing a post I try to determine first and foremost if it is original, or properly cited, content. Community projects like Curie, Steemcleaners, #steemitabuse-classic, etc. are great in assisting with this highest level filter. Next I try to determine if a post will be of interest to others \u2013 is this a link I'd send to friends even if it was on another platform?\n\nAlso important to me is if an author is putting out great content and no one has noticed. Inline with platform growth I have a strong incentive to get eyes on that person's work!\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**There has been a recent rise in your curation efforts. How do you manage your daily activities and curation?**\n\n@riverhead:\nAren't open platforms great? There is no hiding on Steem! As mentioned above my primary goal is to grow value in the platform. Since I have no talent as writer, artist, or journalist this means curating content. A lot of content. Sadly there just aren't enough hours in the day to go through even half the content that's being generated! However I feel it needs to be done. To that end I have enlisted a good friend of mine, who also shares a lot of my values, to curate using my posting key. We are in constant communication and he's always trying to curate in a manner that fits the ethos I discussed above. He is his own person though so I suspect many will look with a raised eyebrow why one post got a vote and another did not. That's fine and all part of this great game!\n\n\nSM:\n**In which way do you think we can we a. Better distribute Steem power b. Improve the prices of Steem and SBD?**\n\n@riverhead:\n\nThis is an issue that will solve itself in time. A lot of the larger stakeholders seem to be idle from a curating perspective and also divesting their Steem Power and selling it. The net results in the short term is a lot of downward pressure on the price. Long term it means Steem will transition from a few early miners to users of the platform. \n\nThere are some that view whales powering down in a bad light. Naturally I am not in that camp but I can hardly claim an unbiased view. That said I do feel it is the best thing they can do to address the distribution issue. We cannot simultaneously want a flatter distribution of Steem and pressure people to not sell their stake. Personally I do not see the difference between one whale powering down a large stake or hundreds of people powering down a smaller stake. In my opinion the mechanic of the 104 week power down schedule levels the playing field from a dumping perspective.\n\nThe organic growth of Steemit, and by extension Steem, is exponential and effectively without bound. The downward pressure caused by my powering down is linear and has a very clear end point. The problem will solve itself so long as Steem is, and continues to be, a success.\n\nAs for the price of SBD I am quite happy with it priced around $1 USD/SBD. Like any stable coin it needs volume for the peg mechanisms to work. To generate volume a token needs some sort of utility. The interest rate on SBD is, again in my opinion, greatly overlooked by many. Also as the Steem platform grows in popularity so will the adoption of SBD by more services; much like the utility Bitcoin enjoys today as a payment token at many vendors.\n\n<br>\n\n\nSM:\n**There have been a number of proposed features on the blockchain? What's your view on the recent 5 votes a day proposal? And powering down whales losing their voting powers?**\n\n\n@riverhead:\n\nFirst let\u2019s just clear up one big misconception: **The goal is not five votes per day nor is that what is being implemented.** It is akin to implying a $5 daily spending budget will only allow someone to buy 5 things. That \nwould only be true if everything cost $1. Want to buy five hundred items? Great \u2013 buy items that are worth $0.01. \n\nWant to vote more than five times per day? Great \u2013 don't vote 100% weight with every mouse click. This change creates incentives for users to better understand voting weights but more importantly makes it much easier to compete with the voting bots. Humans versus bots is the real battleground not whales versus dolphins versus minnows. There have been many great posts on steemit.com that do a much better job of explaining this than I can so I urge people to seek out those posts and educate yourselves.\n\nRemoving voting power from those powering down seems like a knee jerk reaction to a problem that will solve itself in time. I would rather see more focus on increasing demand for the Steem token than creating more barriers to exit. The 104 week power down schedule is sufficient in my opinion.\n\n\nSM:\n**Your personal message to Steemians and projects they should look out for?**\n\n@riverhead:\nWe are still in the twilight dawn of the Steem era and need to take a long view of things to come. There is great danger in band-aid quick fixes to seemingly unfair but temporary issues. Keep producing and curating quality content, spreading the word of Steem, and developing really cool tools and projects that enrich the ecosystem. The world will continue to come to us.\n\nIf I can leave you all with one parting message it is simply to be kind and respectful to one another. Steem is attracting people from all walks of life, religions, opinions, personal experiences, politics, and ambitions. It is simply not possible for everyone to agree with everyone else nor is it possible to beat people into our one world view. Accept gracefully that we will have and need diversity if we want this platform to reach its potential.\n\n---\n\nThanks @riverhead for the really insightful replies.. It\u2019s refreshing to read another perspective on the important issues affecting Steemians.\n\n---\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/4ijigtqcd/An_Exclusive_Interview.png\n\n<h2>A Chat with @firepower</h2>\n\nSteemMag:\n**What are some surprising activities you've noticed so far in the chat channels and what changes would you like to see?**\n\n@firepower:\nInitiatives that I'm part of such as RobinHoodWhale, SteemCleaners have all emerged from the discussions (public and private) on the platform. It was a surprise to see engagement at this level and the motivation amongst users of the platform to collaborate with a single mindset to bring positive changes we wanted to see on the site. I'd like to more users helping each other with the queries as the user participation grows here and lesser trolls and scammers.\n\nI'm currently putting together **\"Steemit Social\" \u2014 a community management team that in its initial stages will handle moderation of certain to-be-designated official channels for steemit related discussions here.** \n\nThat will help consolidate some of our efforts in increasing engagement and retention of good users on Steemit. Hopefully it will lead to more innovative initiatives on Steemit.com as people see the benefits of collaboration and JV on this Steemit.Chat platform and use it to further networking and great content creation. \nAlthough a fair bit of this has been achieved with a number of initiatives that we've seen on the site already but team building for Steemit Social is currently underway.\n\nSteemMag:\n**How are moderators for channels chosen?**\n\n@firepower:\nThere are several channels on Steemit Chat many of which are user created for personal reasons. I personally over see over 50 channels on a regular basis. \n\nFrom this vast number a dozen or so channels have been selected for moderation under Steemit Social initiative. The moderators for these channels are selected on the basis of their current participation on the channels. Those proven to be proactive, helpful, collaborative are considered (if they are willing to step up to the task of moderation) \n\nAlso in addition to this I will be selecting on basis of the time they can devote to moderation and a few other criteria. But they can and will be a mix of old timers and new users.\n\n---\n\nThanks @firepower for having a chat with SteemMag. We wish you all the best :)\n\n---\n\n**Check out page 2 for more awesome features you wouldn't want to miss :)**\n -->[Page 2](https://steemit.com/steemmag/@infovore/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-steemcleaner-steemians-speak-fondest-moment-on-steemit-this-week-on-steemit-steemmag-steemit-s-weekend)",

    "body": "People often notice the many similarities between me and Jesus.  Today, I will attempt to explain the voting power changes coming on the 13th in a parable, just like Jesus would.  \n\nGoing into this, I\u200b want to correct an error in my earlier post on the subject.  In my earlier post, I misunderstood some graphs on the white paper and assumed that the vote target was a \"sweet spot\" and that going above or below it would result in a penalty to voting power.  This, in fact, is not true.  You are only penalized for casting too few votes, not for casting too many.  If you cast more than the target number of votes, your decreased voting power will be entirely offset by your increased number of actual votes.  \n\nYou can read some of the discussion that led to this post [here](https://steemit.com/steem-help/@biophil/announcement-all-votes-will-be-up-to-8-times-more-powerful-in-new-hard-fork) and [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@sigmajin/what-every-user-should-know-about-the-upcoming-change-in-voting)\n\n## <center> **The 5 Curating Brothers** </center>\nImagine for a moment that there are 5 brothers.  These five brothers do all of the curating on steemit.  They all have the same amount of steem power.  In this theoretical steemit system, the total daily reward pool  is $8,500.\n<center>http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--830x553/public/articles/155658114.jpg </center>\n* **Andy** devotes the most time to his curating duties.   He casts the target 40 votes per day.\n\n* **Ben** is not as good as Andy at managing his time and his votes, but he still tries.  He casts 30 votes a day.\n\n* **Carl** doesn't have very much time to delegate to curating.  He casts 20 votes a day\n\n* **David** Has even less time.  He casts 10 votes a day.\n\n* **Frank** barely has any time to devote to curation, he casts 5 votes a day.\n\nIn total, 85 votes are cast every day to award $8500.  Each vote, therefore, is worth $100.\n\n# <center> Brothers Vote Value At the 40 Vote per Day Target</center>\nX | votes cast per day | Median Vote strength | Adjusted Votes Per Day|  total value cast per day\n------------ | ------------- | -------------  | -------------   | -------------\nAndy | 40 | 1 |40 | $4000\nBen | 30| 1 | 30 | $3000\nCarl | 20 | 1 |20 | $2000\nDavid | 10 | 1 |10 | $1000\nFrank | 5 | 1 | 5| $500\n**Total** | **85** | **1** | **85** |**$8500**\n\nNote that, for a fixed amount of steem power and reward pool, Andy is unique in that he cannot earn more money by voting more.  He wouldn't lose money, but the change to his voting power would make any vote above 40 a wipe.  He actually _can_ lose money by clumping his votes.  Ideally, at 40 votes, he should be able to cast every single one of his 40 votes at 100% power by spacing his votes at 36-minute intervals through the day.  If there was a super-Andy who cast 80 votes per day, his adjusted vote value would be the same as Andy's, because he would be unable to cast his full 80 votes and also wait long enough to cast them all at 100%.\n\n# <center> Brothers Vote Value at the 5 vote per day target </center>\nX | votes cast per day |Median Vote Value | Adjusted  |  total value cast per day\n------------ | ------------- | -------------  | -------------  | -------------\nAndy | 40 | .125 | 5 |$1700\nBen | 30| .166 | 5| $1700\nCarl | 20 | .25 |  5 |$1700\nDavid | 10 | .50  |5 | $1700\nFrank | 5 | 1 |5 |$1700\n**Total** | **85** | **.29** | **25**|**$8500**\n\nNotice that, because they are above the vote target, Andy, Ben, Carl, and David all have median vote values below 1.0 Just like Super Andy in the previous example, the \"extra\" votes that they cast above the target threshold attenuate their voting power.  Andy could bring his voting down to 5/day  (just like frank) and be able to cast 100% votes, but it wouldn't really make a difference.  He is not being penalized for casting too many votes.\n\nNote here that the monetary value  of a single 100% vote did go up.  \n<center>\nTo begin with, it was \n<center>\n` 8500 / 85 =100 `\n\nAfter the target change, it is \n\n` 8500 /25 = $340 `\n</center>\nIn this particular case, it went up just over  200%.   However, this increase was insufficient to make up for the 87% decrease in the number of votes that could be cast.  The farther away each brother was from actually casting the maximum number of votes, the less his average influence was effected.\n\nTo use shennanigator's model, if you could cast 40 100% votes per day worth 10 cents each before the change, after the change you would be able to cast 5 100% votes worth 34 cents after the change.\n\nHere are the before and after numbers for the total $ influence exerted by the  brothers.\nx  | 40 vote target  | 5 vote target | %  gain/loss\n------------ | ------------- | -------------| -------------\nAndy | $4000  |$1700 |-57.5%\nBen | $3000  |$1700 |-10%\nCarl | $2000  |$1700 | -15%\nDavid| $1000  |$1700 | +70%\nFrank | $500  |$1700 | +240%\n\n# Lowering the Bar Does not Improve Participation(it just improves how many get over the bar)\n\nBiophil wrote in my previous thread\n> It just depends on total voter participation; if participation goes up (a good thing), the increase won't be 8x. If it goes down (a bad thing), the increase will actually be more than 8x. It's very difficult to predict.\n\nThis is somewhat misleading.  Imagine a classroom with 40 students in it.  At the end of the year, 4 students are scheduled to be awarded a certificate for perfect attendance.  On the very last day, the principal comes into the classroom and announces that, in addition to the 4 students who actually have perfect attendance, 10 students who have been absent 2 days or less will also get the certificate. \n<center>\nhttps://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/lowering-the-bar.jpg\n</center>\nBy doing this, the principal has not, in fact, increased attendance.  He has merely increased the superficial appearance of attendance by rewarding imperfect attendance the same way he rewards perfect attendance.   In the same sense, the 5-day target does not increase participation.  It merely gives the same reward to lower participation as it does to higher.\n\nIn fact, it disincentivizes high participation.  In the new system, there is less reason for andy to take the time to read and vote on 40 posts.  He can still do so, but why should  he?  He can be like frank, put in much less work, and get the same level of influence.\n\n# I heard the new voting target is helping fight bots... how is it doing that?\n\nIt's really not.  At least, not directly.  It does hurt bots (because most bots are Andys, though I would argue that most Andys are not bots).  Basically, if you're a high power frank, this new target helps you at the expense of _all_ andy's, bots included.  When we say this decreases the influence of bots, what we really mean is that it decreases the influence of _all_ very active curators.\n#  <center>  Which brother are you?  </center>\nIf you look at the charts above, it becomes clear that there are two factors that influence how the change to a 5 vote target will affect each individual voter.\n\n1.  How close are you to optimal voting right now?  If you're an andy or a ben, you're probably going to see a decrease in influence.\n2.  How close is everybody else?  If you're currently  a more optimal voter than average, this will definitely hurt you.  If you're a less optimal voter, this will definitely help you.  \n<center>\n</center>\nIn a world where every poster was an andy, this change would have precisely the type of cosmetic effect @shenanigator and others have described.  If everyone on steemit were a Frank or a Dave, and there were only a few Andy's, this vote would decrease the voting power of the andy's significantly.\n\nAt the end of the day, what you need to take away from this and my other post on the topic is that this change is not cosmetic, or a \"bug fix\", or a way to give users two dollar bills for 8 quarters.  It is a very real re-distribution of influence with very real consequences to active curators.  We should look long and hard at the effects of this redistribution when it happens, because its very possible that some of the best curators here will, to coin a phrase, get Franked in the Andy.",

But most of the day is hard work is sorting through the new section of steemit, basically trying to figure out if a post is legitimate or not. There's a few \"tells\" whether or not a post is more likely to be plagiarized (e.g. a new account), or a spun article (e.g. broken english), and sometimes it's just intuition.\n\nAnother part of the day is unfortunately drama, and trying to convince people that what we are doing is justified. Not everyone cares about producing original content, and a lot of people don't mind if someone gets paid for someone else\u2019s work, and sometimes there isn't much we can do to change their minds.\nAnd finally, we also try our best to generally help people. For example, people who have been unjustly flagged (see the r4fken case), we upvote them to unhide their posts/comments.\n\nSM:\n**Do you think your anti-plagiarism, anti-ID theft campaign is bearing fruits?**\n\n@anyx:\nI don't think we have made any significant progress. Guiding new users in the right direction is one thing, but unless our message reaches the higher ups, we are fruitless in our endeavours.\n\nThe majority of whales are unconvinced in what we are trying to accomplish (@steemcleaners only has a very select group of followers and helpers), and furthermore, some whales go completely against our ideology. For example, one whale upvoted a bunch of recipe articles, to hundreds of dollars each. Within the same day, we saw a flurry of new accounts created that were just plagiarizing recipes, literally spamming tons of plagiarized content, hoping to \"catch\" said whale.\n\nAnd it worked. The whale upvoted many of the plagiarized recipes, and these spammers were rewarded. Sadly, when an average user sees this happen -- when spammers get rewarded, and they get nothing for their hard work -- they get frustrated and probably get tempted to leave the site. That's possibly contributing to the downturn in activity and price here.\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**What from your own perspective should steemians look out for before upvoting or flagging a post?**\n\n@anyx:\nI say this over and over again, but no one listens. And I expect once again that no one will.\nStop upvoting things without first considering who the poster is.\n\nThis isn't facebook or reddit, your votes aren't worthless. They mean something, and you should take consideration on what you are rewarding, as what gets rewarded will be incentivized to continue, just like I mentioned with the recipe example. The more plagiarism gets upvoted, the more we will see of it. But on the other hand, the more that good, original content gets upvoted, the more of it we will see. So be selective, you are literally shaping the future of steemit with your votes.\n\nI have noticed that most people don't bother to flag spam or plagiarism, and that is sorely disappointing to me. Do take the time to flag spam, at the very least. We are witnessing a \"bystander effect\" where everyone is watching this garbage appear but almost no one is taking action to stop it. \n\nSM:\n**How's cheetah doing?**\n@anyx:\nCheetah is running along as good as she has ever been. A lot of her actions recently have been for flagging spam, and I am hoping to work on some more advanced features for this shortly. Not much to say about her, as I've been less active these past two weeks due to real life obligations, but more will come soon. :)\n\n<br>\n\nSM:\n**Which blockchain based features would you like to see as soon as possible?**\n\n@anyx:\nThis is a tough question. There was a lot of talk on some potential censorship that came with \"negative voting\" or \"vote cancelling\" that was discussed recently, and I agree that these things need a lot more consideration before they are implemented. That may come to a surprise to many of you whom consider me to be some sort of thought police or even \"hitler\"; but yes, I am against actual censorship.\n\nThe blockchain based feature here on Steemit that I would most look forward to is a more fluid way to use the witness list for rewarding Steemit activities. Right now the list is quite static, and the reward that the small oligarch gets is quite large. I would much like to see the oligarch break into a more decentralized approach, such that other users and projects would have access to the witness funds.\n\nI know many people would use their witness funds for good projects. For example, if I were a witness I would use ALL the funding to reward anyone fighting abuse. The robinhoodwhale or curie projects could use the funds as power to curate better. Many developers not in the top 19 are doing absolutely fantastic work too. But unfortunately, I do not even know where a lot of the funding is currently going -- so a smarter, more transparent, and more decentralized approach here would be very cool.\n\n---\n\nThanks @anyx for taking the time to have an interview with SteemMag. Great job you\u2019re doing. All the best\n\n---\n<br>\n\n<h2> Steemians Speak \u2013What\u2019s Your Fondest Memory On Steemit</h2>\n\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/o30wf6d75/CUPCAKE.png\n\nDespite the various issues we\u2019re facing on Steemit, we\u2019ve all had really exciting times on Steemit. To look at this weekend\u2019s theme from another perspective, SteemMag reached out to a number of Steemains asking them:\n\n<h2> What\u2019s Your Fondest Moment on Steemit?</h2>\n@camilla \nMy best Steemit memory must be finding @stellabelle\u2019s posts when I first joined this community. She was one of the first women I saw posting on Steem and she was brave, free, honest and full of great ideas. She encouraged me to start writing and creating my own work. Thank you StellaBelle!\n\n@anduweb \nMy first whale upvote. \nI remember having the idea to create steem.ly and having this nervousness to get the domain before anyone else, deploying the app and writing the announcement post. Many hours in the making and it was a great idea to not clog messages with long ugly links but list them simply with a cool looking short link like steem.ly/xyz. \n\nI remember reading the post dozens of times before pressing Post, tweaking it to perfection. After posting it, i had the post on one screen autorefreshing the page and steemitx on the 2nd screen constantly checking the stream of votes from the filtered list of whales. My heart was in a tight grip, waiting to see what recognition it gets.\n\nI kept staring at the screens for hours and at one point I laid back on the couch still looking at the monitors, falling asleep in shots (it was way past midnight) waking up from time to time. \nAnd in a sleepy glance i saw it, an upvote from @dantheman. I jumped from the couch and confirmed it. I screamed of joy inside. I would have done it loudly but everyone else was asleep and would have called me crazy. But I am crazy. Steemit crazy. #steemon\n\n<br>\n@dwinblood:\nThey are a moving mass that vie for which one excites me the most, Larken Rose joining, wow this is real I'm making money, my @chaospoet resurrection actually working and being an unusual outlet, and the acceptance and reception of the steemit community for articles personal in nature I was expecting ridicule and instead received support.\n\n@ash \nmy [first post]( https://steemit.com/technology/@ash/hello-world) and to learn and see what Graphene Technology is capable of\n\n@mrwang \nMy fondest memory on steemit is actually a tie, lol... \nWhen I found the-alien post \"zen and the art of not giving a fuck\" not only did it inspire me to write and re-release a very personal video dedicated to my grandmother but was literally a blueprint of my climb to success as an Actor/Filmmaker Episode 5 Goodbye American Beauty of my awareness campaign #nobodysperfect \n\nThe other was the moment I realized how much of a positive influence I became when I took a huge gamble by releasing Episode 1 - Awareness steemit.com \u2026 I didn't know how the community was going to receive it and what I did was open a door for others dealing with similar struggles to feel confident about sharing those struggles with everybody on Steemit.\n\n<br>\n\n@romanskv \nWhen I received the high evaluation of this artistic [work]( https://steemit.com/art/@romanskv/hi-steemit-i-present-to-you-my-outsider-works)\n\n@illuminaughti \nThe moment that sticks out for me was when I had my first \u2018big hit\u2019. I was at work when I saw the payout go up to $200 and started to have a \u201cmanic attack\u201d. My head was spinning, my cheeks were flushed. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I went from being unsure if I could buy food this week to being paid for creating something I was passionate about! You always remember your first!\n\n@sauravrungta \nThe discovery of Steemit itself is the fondest memory. I remember the day I came across this site and was completely blown away. I couldn't sleep that night and the whole week that followed!\nWithin Steemit itself, my fondest memory was when I received my first compliment for my article. This was so new to me and having people actually appreciate your content is just wow!\n\n@royaltiffany\nMy fondest memory of Steemit, was when I discovered it. The novelty, the excitement of finding something new, the research and all the questions...it was a thrill!\n\n\n---\n\n<h2>This Week On Steemit</h2>\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/07/30/THETRAVELLER26edca.jpg\nA lot of interesting events happened this week.

    "body": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Emblem_of_Italy.svg/390px-Emblem_of_Italy.svg.png\nImage Credit\n>In a recent, very inspirational post @gavvet has highlighted the importance (both from a cultural and a community development viewpoint) of fostering the growth of linguistic diversity on Steemit. \nhttps://steemit.com/languages/@gavvet/the-birth-of-linguistic-diversity-on-steemit\n\nIn un post pubblicato recentemente, @gavvet ha messo in evidenza l\u00b4importanza (sia dal punto di vista culturale che in termini di sviluppo della comunita\u00b4) della crescita della diversita\u00b4 linguistica su Steemit.\n\n>Publishing high-quality content in languages other than English (possibly including English translations to increase visibility) is a key step towards making Steemit viral worldwide. However, at the moment posting on Steemit in \u201cforeign\u201d languages is a bit of a chicken and egg game\u2026 \n\n>Many people feel their language community is too small for their native language post to have an impact, but at the same time everybody acknowledges that the community will hardly grow unless they publish more posts in their own language and then share them on e.g.Facebook, so that outsiders can discover Steemit and decide to join.\n\nLa pubblicazione di materiale di qualita\u00b4 su Steemit in lingue diverse dall\u00b4inglese (eventualmente con una traduzione in inglese per aumentarne la visibilita\u00b4) e\u00b4 un passaggio chiave per la crescita virale di Steemit su scala globale. Tuttavia, al momento la pubblicazione su Steemit in lingue \u201cstraniere\u201d e\u00b4 bloccata in un circolo vizioso...\nMolti considerano che la propria comunita\u00b4 linguistica e\u00b4 troppo piccola perche\u00b4 un post in lingua originale abbia un impatto visibile, ma allo stesso tempo tutti sono d\u00b4accordo nel dire che la comunita\u00b4 non puo\u00b4 crescere se non si pubblicano piu\u00b4 post in lingua originale e non si condividono su Facebook, ecc, per permettere a persone esterne di scoprire Steemit ed iscriversi.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Trevi_fountain_2015.jpg/640px-Trevi_fountain_2015.jpg\nImage Credit\n>I think that one way out of this deadlock involves seeking help from a highly visible \u201cwhale\u201d, willing to promote foreign language posts (including English translation) through the \u201cfeatured author\u201d scheme. The idea is that if such posts make a sizeable impact, this will raise awareness of the size of the language community and motivate foreign language writers. As my native language is Italian, and @gavvet has kindly agreed to support this idea, I am asking all Italian authors who are interested in writing a bilingual (English/Italian) post to be featured by @gavvet, to get in touch with me @claudiop63 via the chat and also to join the #italian channel in order to discuss strategies, etc.\n\nLet\u00b4s bring more Italy into Steemit!  \n-\n\nRitengo che una strategia per spezzare il circolo vizioso possa essere quella di farsi aiutare da una \u201cwhale\u201d che sia pronta a promuovere post in lingua straniera (che includano una traduzione in inglese), attraverso il sistema \u201cfeatured author\u201d. L\u00b4idea e\u00b4 che se tali post avranno un impatto visibile, la comunita\u00b4 linguistica si rinsaldera\u00b4 e gli autori saranno motivati a pubblicare in lingua originale.\nVisto che io sono di madrelingua italiana, e che @gavvet ha gentilmente accettato di sostenere questa strategia, chiedo a tutti gli autori italiani interessati a pubblicare post bilingui (Italiano/Inglese) come featured authors di @gavvet di contattarmi @claudiop63 tramite la chat e di entrare, se non lo hanno gia\u00b4 fatto, nel canale #italian, per poi discutere strategie, ecc.\n\nCerchiamo di riempire Steemit di Italia!\n-",
