    "body": "![The Crown Family Photo](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/the-crown-family1.png 'The Crown Family Photo')\n\nMy Family is Pretty Cool\n-\n![Family](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/family-800.jpg 'Family')\n\nMy favorite people in the world are my children. They are kind, generous, full of life, fun to be around and crazy creative. They are really cool people.\n\nWe have four children, Alex, Ashley, Abby and Austin. My wife's idea to name them all \"A\" names. They are referred to as the \"A Team\".\n\nWe have a close family. We argue very little and maintain open communication. We have treated them like people from early on and they have behaved as such.\n\n![Guitar](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/guitar.png 'Guitar')\n\n\n\nAn Eye Opening Experience\n-\nA few weeks ago I was in Dallas visiting a friend whom I had not seen in many years. There were other people there as well that I had also not seen in a very long time. I struck up a conversation with one of them and the discussion of family ensued. He told me about his children and what it had been like for him to become a father. He has a wonderful family with children that are still very young. When the time came for me to share about my children, I began listing off what each one was doing from the oldest to the youngest. Before I could get to the youngest one, his mouth was gaped open and he burst out, \"What are you feeding them!\" We had a big laugh as I told him about the youngest and expanded on our philosophy of family.\n\nWe have had many compliments on our children throughout their life. Even today, the people with whom they interact; family, friends and the people who work with them in stage productions, make a point of complimenting them. I am around them all the time, and many of their friends are homeschooled as well so sometimes I forget how special they are and the impact they have on others.\n\n![Railroad tracks](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-railroad-tracks-600.jpg 'Railroad tracks')\n\nWhy Am I Sharing\n-\nI hope to convey a few things here. First, if you are considering homeschooling and have reservations, may these stories encourage you. If you already homeschool and wonder if it is all worth it, maybe our stories will give you hope and encouragement as well.\n\nAnd lastly, I am proud of them and want to share their success with you.\n\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/children-800.jpg 'Children')\n\nWhy We Homeschool\n-\nMy personal experience in public schools was a nightmare. I moved a lot when I was young and changed schools every three to six months. During one stretch of five years, I switched schools nineteen times. I did not build long term relationships and being the new kid all the time often created struggles with teachers.\n\nThere is a very long story to my history so I will not get into that here. It is however, the main reason I became excited about homeschooling when my wife suggested it.\n\nOur Oldest Child Alex\n-\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alexthrowback.jpg 'Alex')\n\nAlex has always been intelligent as I believe all children are. He had memorized many of the family members phone numbers and home addresses by the time he was six. We started him off in Montessori school at age four where he attended three years. We would have kept him in Montessori but they did not offer classes above six years old. \n\nAt that time my wife was still concerned about her ability to homeschool so we enrolled him in a Christian private school for one year. After that, she had researched enough to build her confidence. She was ready to go. (As the years went by, she found out that she was more than capable. We are guides.)\n\nPre-Teen\n-\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-littlekid1.jpeg 'Alex and Sister')\n\nAlex took two years of Latin and one year of Japanese. He acted in plays and did what most children do, play a lot.\n\nTeen Years\n-\n![Sis](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/ateam.jpg 'Alex and Sister')\n\nMany people will tell you that you will have to deal with the teenage years. \"Brace yourself,\" they will say. \"You will become their enemy!\" We did not experience this with Alex or our other children. Alex would come to me for advice about issues him and his friends were discussing. When he would share how I reacted to some of our serious conversations, his friends were astonished and would respond with descriptions of their parents exploding if they attempted to have the same discussions with their parents.\n\nKeeping your cool when one of your children comes to you with a confession is a sure way to have them trust you with other issues of concern.\n\nDuring his teen years, Alex took CLEP tests and earned twelve college hours.\n\nAt sixteen, he began to gain interest in programming. I had introduced it to him when he was nine but he wasn't interested. Then again around eleven but still no interest. At sixteen, the interest was all his. Had I forced him to do it earlier, he may have never liked it.\n\n![Graduation](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/graduation.jpg 'Graduation')\n\nBecoming an Adult\n-\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/alex-adult1.jpeg 'Alex')\n\nOne his eighteenth birthday, he begin working his first job as a software developer. He was hired as an apprentice and was promoted to junior developer after only three months. At that time, he began mentoring two of his friends. Within a few months he had taken on a third person to mentor. Within a year or so, each of them have now changed their path and work as software developers. It has significantly changed their lives. Alex just recently began mentoring another friend. Pretty cool to pass forward. He had received help from some of my co-workers early on which made all the difference in his progression.\n\nHe now speaks French and Mandarin and has aspirations to learn many more. He has traveled to seven countries and has an arrangement with his employer to work from anywhere in the world as long as he is at the office for part of the year.\n\n![Alex](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/amsterdamcollage.jpg 'Alex')\n\nHe gives technical talks at local meet ups, plays both acoustic and electric guitar, has never met a stranger and has made no enemies.\n\nHe is an inspiration to others, his family and siblings. The bar has been set high but the other children have many interests and accomplishments of their own. I'll share those in subsequent posts.\n\n![Leon](http://steemit-dub.s3.amazonaws.com/alex/leoncollage.jpg 'Leon')\n\nWhat was our part?\n-\nMy wife has worked hard to keep them supplied with good school material, staying compliant with state requirements and providing some structure for learning. We never set up a school room like environment. There are never set hours of study. Homeschooling hours vary depending on the age of the child and what they are working on at that phase of their education. I would say that most of the time they spend less time doing actual school work and the rest of the time exploring, using their imagination and focusing their energy on things they are interested in.\n\nFor Alex, that was a foreign language. Other times it was memorizing all the Pokemon cards and building decks and playing in tournaments. Alex said one of the things that has helped him so much in learning new things was the fact that he had memorized so much Pokemon data. He developed the ability to store and retrieve things in his mind.\n\nThe simple fact is\u2026 we didn't do it. Alex did. He deserves all the credit. He did all the work. We provided the canvas, the paint and the paintbrushes. \n\nConclusion\n-\nI feel we have a pretty cool family. There are many ways to raise your children. The most important thing is to love them unconditionally, give them room to grow and treat them as you would your very best friend. They are people and are smarter than most give them credit.\n\nI hope I have been able to convey how proud we are of Alex. These are but a few highlights of his life as he is only twenty-one. There is so much in store for him.\n\nI am so grateful that as much as possible we have given Alex the opportunity to live life on his own terms and he has flourished.",

Through time writers of all kinds being the sensitive, emotional and deep people that they are, have always associated the rain with loneliness. Today, whenever a cold wind blows through an open window or an empty space on a street, we are swept with its glum, warning us of a heavy feeling, reminding us of what we have lost, memories that are only too sad we almost wish could bury everything in a shroud of oblivion. Regrets come again, as well as faces of people from the past as a teardrop suddenly threatens to fall anytime from already lost and almost hollow eyes. The cold brought by the rain along with the dark clouds lurking outside makes us want to wrap our arms protectively around ourselves to keep us warm or to shut out any sad thoughts that dare to overstep the arms engulfing our curled bodies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/6iwlyw.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>But its not always like that. Not if we can help it, no. The Rain is perceived negatively most of the time but we can care enough to see beyond what is often seen. GO, outside on an early September morning and you will see that the rain leaves a magnificent dew drenched flower or a grass all the more alive as the sunlight hits the few drops left from last night's rain. All for you to behold. See that under umbrellas are faces of people smiling and radiant as you meet them on the street. Really, the rain cant be that bad. Not at all. It is natures gift, a gift from the Almighty. And after a rain, what do the heavens hold for you? An array of colors painting the sky and we know it as rainbow. Just as we know that after the tears, laughter comes, making us very much worthy of the joy because of what we have gone through.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i64.tinypic.com/fnzjtl.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>All our days cannot simply be filled with sunshine and it cannot be simply all laughter and smiles. We have to grow as a person just as the rain lets the flowers in the meadow bloom and grow. The flowers need the rain just as much as they need sunshine. Same is true with people. We need to be happy just as we need to be lonely so that we can grow as a person. Then can we only bring ourselves to realize that the bad is not so bad afer all as long as we allow the growth it brings to us as individuals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i63.tinypic.com/16kp014.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>You cannot escape the rain, nor chase it away. Dare to hear its pitter patter rhythm as something which can never be a hindrance for you to see things in a different and brighter way no matter how dark the clouds and heavy the downpour. It is as inevitable as the troubles we come across. Learn from the rain because it is the law of nature. Learn from loneliness or troubles because... It is the law of life.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>(c) to the owner of the picture I used...</p>\n</html>",

    "body": "Within minutes, my whole outlook on Steemit changed.\n\nI am new to the Steemit platform. I decided to give it a try just a day ago. The thing I liked about it right away was the fact that you can post positive blogs and also get paid for this. We need more positive things around us.\n\nWell my last post was a pet safety tips post to help increase awareness on pets in the summer heat. I had original content as a header, but did add some tips in the body of the post of advise I found on a pet safety page.\n\nWithin minutes, I got multiple flags and my rating went from 44 to 18. I understand keeping content original on here, but this is an extremely harsh and negative response to a positive and informal post. This type of aggressive flagging will ultimately drive people away from this website.  I can't even post a picture now.\n\nAll that needed to be done was send a message to request a correction or if it is 100% copied, a moderator should just delete the post and inform the blogger why. These aggressive negative flags that drive a persons reputation instantly down to the floor for one single post will absolutely make people think twice about investing time into this website. I think the flags should be done with altogether because of the negative response it has on content, original or not.\n\nI work in IT and I also am an Animal Rights Advocate. I have a lot to offer Steemit and could help it grow. I have already had one person sign up in 1 day of being a member! But if this ultra aggressive flagging procedure doesn't change, I will be leaving as quickly as I came and also advise others of what I have experienced.\n\nThanks for your time.\nRM",

The interagency group includes representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Justice, Department of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of National Intelligence Office.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"The United States is grateful to the UAE authorities for the manifestation of humanity and willingness to support US efforts, which aim to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay,\" - noted in the Pentagon. Special prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on one of the US bases, was opened in 2001 after the September 11 attacks. In connection with the anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan began receiving prisoners to militants \"Al-Qaeda\", supporters of the \"Taliban\" and other terrorist organizations. Many prisoners alleged that they are subject to such prohibited interrogation methods as sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme temperatures, loud music, waterboarding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2003, the number of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has reached 680 people, compared to January 2016 it decreased to 93 persons. US President Barack Obama was in favor of closing the prison because of its cost and inefficiency. When he became head of state, 245 prisoners are held at Guantanamo. After the transfer of 15 prisoners in the UAE in jail was 61 prisoner. Due to the closure of the US prison authorities hope to reduce budget spending, because every year for the maintenance of Guantanamo spent 445 million dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n</html>",

They love their people, greeting them at the door, following them around the house, and leaping into a lap or snuggling in bed whenever given the chance. They often learn to come when called or to retrieve toys that are thrown for them.\n\nThe word most often used to describe them is docile, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are inactive. They like to play with toys and enter into any family activities. With positive reinforcement in the form of praise and food rewards when they do something you like, Ragdolls learn quickly and can pick up tricks as well as good behaviors such as using a scratching post. In a small, sweet voice, they remind you of mealtime or ask for petting but are not excessively vocal.\n\nRagdolls have nice manners and are easy to live with. You will find a Ragdoll on your sofa or bed, but generally not much higher than that. He prefers to stay on the same level with his people rather than the highest point in a room.\n\nRagdolls are undoubtedly the most Fluffy and Lovable Cats EVER! \n\nCat Friends, please VOTE and Follow!!  =)",

    "body": "Before I had children, I would look at other parents who were giving their children soda and a pacifier and think, \"Those are horrible parents. Don't they know what harm soda is and all the things that are wrong with pacifiers!\" Then I had children. We have four. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be. When children are very young, you cannot reason with them. You cannot get through to them with logic.\n\nI hope you continue on Steemit and share your experiences with your children. You do have children, right?\n\nI love the concepts being presented by this an other posts to raise our children and never discipline them but what I am not seeing are examples of how to do that. Not once they are old enough to reason, between 4 and 6, but before that.\n\nI am a strong opponent to child abuse. I grew up in a **very** unstable home. That was something I did not want and did not do in my own family but each of my children did receive a few spankings when they were very young. Once they were old enough to reason with, we discussed matters and consequences came into play.\n\nI have a post on my oldest son, he is 21 now and I talk about homeschooling and letting children play a large role in their life. It is __their__ life after all.\n\nhttps://steemit.com/life/@craigwilliamz/how-to-raise-fantastic-children-part-1",

    "body": "That is why it is necessary to close the camera on the laptop. I did not know about this danger!\nBe careful, for you can watch via webcam! Even the director of the FBI acknowledges that adheres the protective tape on her laptop.\nhttps://marketium.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b35.jpg\nIn recent decades, manufacturers of electronic products have tried to improve its products and inserted all the better camera technology, which we use almost every day.\nToday, however, it can be seen that the market is full of various labels and plastic covers, which are designed to cover the front camera on different devices: phones, laptops and even TVs. What was the reason for the appearance of such products?\nhttp://izbavljaemsja.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kak-izbavitsa-ot-carapin-na-kamere-telefona-650x340.jpg\nFor many years in the field of computer security researchers warned that hackers and intruders can obtain an image with a camera without the user's knowledge, and remotely monitor the people. But laptops, tablets, phones, or \"see\" TV significant part of your personal life!\nNot long ago, FBI Director James Comey made a sensational confession: \"I stuck to the camera with a special film because I saw how it was done by those who are smarter and more experienced than me.\"\nThat's why companies producing covers and stickers for web cameras, called the production \"a bestseller on the market today.\"\nThose who know better than anyone that the Internet is always watching you, have long been used to close the camera. This is the first rule of safety, if you do not want your personal life became the property of Internet users.\nEva Galperin, an analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told reporters that always covers the camera on my laptop since the time when it bought its first MacBook Pro in 2007.\nElectronic Frontier Foundation began to print their labels for webcams in 2013. They sell and distribute stickers for the camera, which states the following:\n\"These removable stickers - anti-surveillance technology, which is impossible to crack.\"\nA spokesman for the organization said that people are constantly buying such devices.\nFear of web-cameras have long penetrated into modern society. For example, in the trailer of a new biopic about the employee of the CIA 'Snowden' protagonist glances nervously at his laptop camera at the time of the intimate scenes with his girlfriend.\nWhy is everyone so afraid of cameras, and is there a real reason to do so?\nIt turns out that this is not paranoia, and not science fiction. Back in 2013 a group of researchers have shown how you can easily activate the camera Macbook transparent to the user, without the inclusion of green light.\nA couple of America said that the hacker posted on the network of their home video of an intimate nature, which he received after breaking a smart TV. It is already known that the FBI and other intelligence agencies, too, are well aware of how to use a laptop camera to follow the user!\nMany have already earned a lot of money on this!\nCamPatch company describes itself as the most successful company among manufacturers of protective tapes for webcams. CamPatch was created in 2013 after the founders have watched presentations by experts in the field of cybersecurity Pentagon. It said that the webcam - a new \"attack vector.\"\nCamPatch Management does not disclose all financial information, but they said that the company received a \"six-figure income over the past few years,\" sold more than 250,000 labels. And it's a given that the company sells its products at an affordable price (at $ 2.79).\nDo not use protective tapes only careless people and those who are not yet aware of the danger!\nWith the development of modern services, there are more opportunities to spy on users!\nSmart speaker from Echo of Amazon.com, who knows how to listen to the commands of their owners, was a great success immediately after the release. Google is also going to release a similar product called Google Home.\nIn February this year the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, acknowledged that the so-called \"Internet of Things\" can be used \"for the identification, surveillance, monitoring, tracking, location and orientation for employment or to gain access to the network or user credentials \".\nDo you already use a protective cover for the camera on their devices?",
