            "body": "Hi, I'm A.M for now, I'm in my mid-20s and want to share my story with working and facing this thing called life after I watched a lot of YouTubers like Thomas James \"TomSka\" David Brown “boyinaband” and many others who have very openly shared their hardships, they have inspired me to write this….. Whatever this is.\nI don't consider myself a good writer so bare with me here.\nTo try to keep this post organized and make sense I'll highlight the point I want to talk about and tell the relevant part of my story, you can connect the pieces all together at the end.\n\n**First how am I?** \nI grow up in the countryside I went to normal school when I was yang, because I was the quiet introvert and wasn't from the town I was in I got bullied a lot for most of my time at school, I got through school time knowing just two friends, I was OK with it.\nI genuinely lost interest in school when I was in the ninth grade It seemed more like a memory test than a way of learning so I started looking for ways to make money, \"why waste time learning things irrelevant in real life if I can make money now\" my naive 16 years old self said, don't get me wrong I didn't think I was done with learning I just wanted to learn in my own way, and I didn't stop school, now I'm in part time Business school, so back then I started looking for any way to make money in the last 5 year I tried: working in sales for over 2  years, selling products online, becoming instructor online, worked as SEO & social media consultant, tried starting my own business for 4 times, and for the last year and half I taught myself how to program and how to use Unity game engine and now I'm working on my first game, I can easily and proudly say that I didn't succeed at any of what I did so far, but I've learned a lot every time and I would do it all over again if I had the chance.\nThe process of picking myself up every single freaking time was a living hell and I got desperate many times.\nbecause I saw a lot of people feeling relevant to what David said in his video I want to share how I managed to keep my sanity and my opinion about some point he brought in his video.\n\n\n**Not thinking your work is good enough:**\nIs that really a bad thing? not being satisfied with what you just accomplished is a sign that you always look forward to what you still can do.\nI remember after I published my first course on Udemy I got invited to a hangout and I went for it I thought I'll give myself some slack, while I was there someone shouted out \"this guy here just published his first course let all give him a clap shall we\" for some reason he thought that was a good idea, I don't think I can blame him his intentions were good, I never tried to put a smile as hard as I did that moment I guess I just didn't want to look like a selfish prick, but the truth that I wasn't happy about what I accomplished I was thinking about my bad English poor structure of the course and was I being a sellout for trying to sell my knowledge? halfway of creating the course, I was already thinking about 5 other things I wanted to do next.\nI think there's nothing wrong about not being satisfied with what you finish, I think It's a good sign of an ambitious creator.\nWhen you first make the decision to accomplish something It looks like that godly thing that you think It would feel good to have or do, but when you start turning that big sexy thing to a small to-do list somewhere the appeal you had to that thing will disappear to a certain point, it's not that godly sexy thing you thought about before it's becoming a part of your routine now you know the process of doing that thing It's not a mystery anymore.\nI think that's why they say: \"It's about the journey, not the destination\".\n\n\n**Not taking care of yourself:**\nIt's hard to keep taking care of yourself to others people standards, whether it's about looking ripped putting makeup or buying the latest clothes, instead find your own save point and move forward from there if you feel the need to.\nWhen I was working in seals I had to look my best most of the time's which was exhausting more than the work itself and what made it worst is that some coworkers starting hinting that I need to start working out to look sharper and more confident.\nBecause I was desperate for results from my work I started going to the gym and I got stuck at joining for a month or two then giving up for half a year couple of times, every time I stopped going to the gym I over beat myself saying that I need this for my work, I need more money to do a lot of things, if this work didn't go well what else Am I going to do, eventually I usually took it out on food, I don't even want to start thinking what would have happened to me if my body was able to store fat.\nTrying to take care of yourself to others standards can be very exhausting, I felt down because I was putting so much effort in things I don't really care about to get others approval, I genuinely don't care about having a ripped body, it would look cool sure but I'm not willing to put all that effort into health and looks at least for now, who knows maybe in the future things will be better and I'll be willing  to put the effort necessary to have 6 pack abs (wink wink ladies).\nNowadays I eat better than I used to, I still eat some junk food but things are much much better than they were 2 years ago, when I fell down I still go buy and drink a liter of Pepsi but at some point that was my morning coffee, as for my looks I cut my hair very short so I would have one less thing to worry about in the morning, I shave my beard once every couple of weeks I change my cloth every two or three days even if I didn't go out.\nThe point is I take care of myself for my own sack, It was much worse before and I'll always keep working to improve pit by pit.\nIt's about building habits not getting motivated for a couple of weeks then beating yourself for not being able to keep up.\n\n\n**Not mastering one skill:**\nI worked in sales, instructed online, worked as SEO and social media consultant, self taught myself how to program and make games but I don’t think I’m the right person to talk about this, all I’m saying that if you didn’t find that one true call that is right for you, you might be a “multipotentialite” if you want to know what exactly does this mean I urge you to watch Emilie talk at TedX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8\nAnd check the blog too if you want to know more \nhttp://puttylike.com/\n\n**Everything happens for a reason........ or does it?**\nWhen I was young I was fortunate to know a good old religious man, I don’t know about your perspective about religions but hear me out this isn’t a sermon, I still remember when he tried to teach me that everything happens for a reason I was like “WHAT……. Oh really, then what is the reason for this and this and that” my question didn’t stop and I wasn’t asking nicely either yet, somehow he was calm about it like some kind of monk, I don’t know if I ruined his day or not but I feel bad for taking the world misery out on him that day, he was just a simple man who was doing what he think is good for others, his intentions were good but unfortunately for him I wasn’t a simple person, I overthink everything and everyone, it’s my blessing and my curse,  later I told my family about him and I was surprised that they knew him, apparently everyone knows each other in the countryside, they told me about what he was facing lately personally, financially, and emotionally, I didn’t believe that someone who is facing all that isn’t depressed or angry and even trying to do good for others at least by his believes, I wanted to know more about him he got my interest, I wanted to know if he’s an imposter who is just putting a good face or not because a part of me didn’t believe how can he be that good, I kept asking about him from time to time and sometimes I even went to his “lessons”, eventually I went to face him with what I know about him like a detective facing a criminal, the crime of being that simple yet trying to be better than me, It’s pathetic I know It’s just how my brain works sometimes, because I used to take pride of being logical about everything and not believing in anything without questioning it, it bothered me how can he be at peace with his life and I’m not even that he’s facing a lot more than I’m, I faced him and told him everything then asked how can you be this calm about everything that is happening in your life, he had a faint smile and said “I don’t know the reason for everything that is happening right now but everything happens for a reason” I remember holding my fist hard and walking away, maybe I was holding my fist trying not to hit him for not being realistic like me or probably not to beat myself for not being half the man that he was.\nI don’t know about your perspective about religions and I’m not here to tell you about mine but I respect that some religions teach that everything happens for a reason, is it the truth? Does everything happens for a reason? I don’t know, I don’t think that is even the point, It’s silly to even get in an argument about this because no one can be sure about it, it’s simply just a belief, it’s simply teach you to not overthink about the reasons for everything around you, just learn from it if you can and focus on what you can do, it’s kind of funny for me to tell you not to overthink about somethings because I’m sure my 19 year old me would punch me right in the face, but it’s just too draining and exhausting to try to find a reason for every bad thing that have happened to me or to others.\nIn the last three years two of my best friends died, the first one I knew for about nine years and the other one for around five, both killed, both in a way they didn’t deserve to, each time I had to force myself to focus on the 0.0000001% full part of the cup or else I would have lose my sanity.\nI would hate to think what would be my thought process if someone tried to sell me religion like a product, some of them would be like “Hi son, you should follow my beliefs because I’m 100% sure that I’m right and everybody else is wrong and if you don’t, well you’re FU**ED” that would have disfigured some of the beliefs that helped me get better.\nControlling your stream of thoughts will be the hardest thing you’ll ever have to do in your life, but if mastered it you’ll become unstoppable.\n\n\nI’ve been getting into the game industry for around year and half now, I don’t have any experiance in the field but I’ve other experiences that many don’t, working in sales made me learn a lot about people's motivations and incentives, I saw a lot of people jump to make purchase while other chicken out last minute, you don’t get to learn about this in a book or an NLP course, you only get to learn this experience by working in sales first hand, working as an SEO and social media consultant made me care about the little details like posting in the right social medias that is more relevant to your audience, more isn’t always better, choosing the right words colors and timing for best result, sometimes modifying your content for a better marketing or not going into a certain niche even if there’s an audience for it because it doesn’t suit your brand, teaching online made me learn that the selling point isn’t the end goal, helping and mentoring students even after they have purchased the course was way more important than I thought, the feedback I got about the course was crucial to take the course to the next level and some student even helped me with some marketing.\nIf you know anything about the mobile game industry you can see how these experiences can be helpful, I can imagine the kind of journey I want to create for the player because I can build the motivations and incentives I want for him, while I’m building the player journey I’ll always keep in mind to put the monetization and ads the right way so all of them can work seamlessly together for a better player experience, and taking care of existing players and community will always be a priority, I wasn’t happy and cheerful when I had to learn these experiences the hard way, I thought I was just failing, I even remember crying myself to sleep every time I decided to pull the plug on something I was working on, but eventually It worked out somehow I think.\n“you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life”.\nSteve Jobs\n\n\nI want to share some of the tricks I used that helped my in general to get my life together:\n\n**Music**\nlisten to cheerful music, even if it might not be exactly what you listen to usually but try them for a while, my favorite type or music is Rock and Metal it’s loud and make me feel empowered but sometimes it's not what I need to change my mood so I started listening to electro music mostly Drum & bass, I didn’t like it at first, I’m human I don’t like to change, but forcing myself to listen to it for while change my perspective about it and I started listening to it while I’m working, and it worked.\n\n\n**habits not motivation**\nWe’re slaves to our habits, it’s exhausting to do something that’s you’re not used to for quite a while, so invest your effort and time to build your habits pit by pit no matter how slow it will take, measure your progress and celebrate your success no matter how small they’re, it’ll make all the difference in your life in the long term.\n\n**work in a group**\nNo matter how introverted person you think you’re, you’re still human at the end of day and you need your dose of human interaction so try to work in group if you can, if you don’t have that luxury (like me) work out side from time to time, library, coffee shop, parks all works, changing your surrounding and environment can change your mood, you can try changing your room\\office decor every couple of weeks too.\n\n**warm-blooded pet**\nGet a warm-blooded pet it helps, I tried fish and turtles but didn’t really work for me they just stared at me with their empty eyes, I have a cat for two year now and It helped, maybe it’s having the sense of that there is a creature that needs you to look after him, it’s helped me not to feel completely unworthy in some bad day.\n\n\nFinally I hope this help you in any way it can, and hope it will find its way to all who needs it.",

It explores the state of AI development, overviews its challenges and dangers, features work by the most significant scientists, and describes the main predictions of possible AI outcomes. This project is an adaptation and major shortening of the two–part essay AI Revolution by Tim Urban of Wait But Why. I shortened it by a factor of 3, recreated all images, and tweaked it a bit. Read more on why/how I wrote it here.\nIntroduction\nAssuming that human scientific activity continues without major disruptions, artificial intelligence may become either the most positive transformation of our history or, as many fear, our most dangerous invention of all. AI research is on a steady path to develop a computer that has cognitive abilities equal to the human brain, most likely within three decades (timeline in chapter 5). From what most AI scientists predict, this invention may enable very rapid improvements (called fast take-off), toward something much more powerful — Artificial Super Intelligence — an entity smarter than all of humanity combined (more on ASI in chapter 3). We are not talking about some imaginary future. The first level of AI development is gradually appearing in the technology we use everyday (newest AI advancements in chapter 2). With every coming year these advancements will accelerate and the technology will become more complex, addictive, and ubiquitous. We will continue to outsource more and more kinds of mental work to computers, disrupting every part of our reality: the way we organize ourselves and our work, form communities, and experience the world.\nExponential Growth\nThe Guiding Principle Behind Technological Progress\nTo more intuitively grasp the guiding principles of AI revolution, let’s first step away from scientific research. Let me invite you to take part in a story. Imagine that you’ve received a time machine and been given a quest to bring somebody from the past. The goal is to shock them by showing them the technological and cultural advancements of our time, to such a degree that this person would perform SAFD (Spinning Around From Disbelief).\n\nSo you wonder which era should you time-travel to, and decide to hop back around 200 years. You get to the early 1800s, retrieve a guy and bring him back to 2016. You “…walk him around and watch him react to everything. It’s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with …[a] magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone’s face and chat with them even though they’re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery.”¹ It doesn’t take much. After two minutes he is SAFDing.\nNow, both of you want to try the same thing, see somebody Spinning Around From Disbelief, but in your new friend’s era. Since 200 years worked, you jump back to the 1600s and bring a guy to the 1800s. He’s certainly genuinely interested in what he sees. However, you feel it with confidence — SAFD will never happen to him. You feel that you need to jump back again, but somewhere radically further. You settle on rewinding the clock 15,000 years, to the times “…before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and the concept of civilisations.”² You bring someone from the hunter-gatherer world and show him “…the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being “inside,” and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery”³ — in forms of books. It doesn’t take much. He is SAFDing in the first two minutes.\nNow there are three of you, enormously excited to do it again. You know that it doesn’t make sense to go back another 15,000, 30,000 or 45,000 years. You have to jump back, again, radically further. So you pick up a guy from 100,000 years ago and you you walk with him into large tribes with organized, sophisticated social hierarchies. He encounters a variety of hunting weapons, sophisticated tools, sees fire and for the first time experiences language in the form of signs and sounds. You get the idea, it has to be immensely mind-blowing. He is SAFDing after two minutes.\nSo what happened? Why did the last guy had to hop → 100,000 years, the next one → 15,000 years, and the guy who was hopping to our times only → 200 years?\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Wbd0td3DqD3pJo7_YHjkbQ.gif\n\n“This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster rate than less advanced societies — because they’re more advanced. [1800s] humanity knew more and had better technology…”⁴, so it’s no wonder they could make further advancements than humanity from 15,000 years ago. The time to achieve SAFD shrank from ~100,000 years to ~200 years and if we look into the future it will rapidly shrink even further. Ray Kurzweil, AI expert and scientist, predicts that a “…20th century’s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that another 20th century’s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years⁵…A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century’s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month⁶…Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve 1,000 times the progress of the 20th century.”⁷\n“Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they’ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human. Kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what’s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that’s coming next.”⁸\nThe Road to Artificial General Intelligence\nBuilding a Computer as Smart as Humans\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is a broad term for the advancement of intelligence in computers. Despite varied opinions on this topic, most experts agree that there are three categories, or calibers, of AI development. They are:\nANI: Artificial Narrow Intelligence\n1st intelligence caliber. “AI that specializes in one area. There’s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that’s the only thing it does.”⁹\nAGI: Artificial General Intelligence\n2nd intelligence caliber. AI that reaches and then passes the intelligence level of a human, meaning it has the ability to “reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.”¹⁰\nASI: Artificial Super Intelligence\n3rd intelligence caliber. AI that achieves a level of intelligence smarter than all of humanity combined — “ranging from just a little smarter … to one trillion times smarter.”¹¹\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5AkzXZJoVXRrGNSOO8ZojQ.gif\n\nWhere are we currently?\n“As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI — ANI — in many ways, and it’s everywhere:”¹²\n“Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes kick in, to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems.”¹³\n“Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook’s Newsfeed.”¹⁴\nEmail spam filters “start off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what’s spam and what’s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to your particular preferences.”¹⁵\nPassenger planes are flown almost entirely by ANI, without the help of humans.\n“Google’s self-driving car, which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it.”¹⁶\n“Your phone is a little ANI factory … you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow’s weather, talk to Siri.”¹⁷\n“The world’s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems.”¹⁸\n“Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets¹⁹).”²⁰\n“ANI systems as they are now aren’t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like”²¹ a plane crash, a nuclear power plant malfunction, or “a financial markets disaster (like the 2010 Flash Crash when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected) … But while ANI doesn’t have the capability to cause an existential threat, we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that’s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI.”²²\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ia8wUuZPxpUNzvUjNRsxpA.gif\n\nWhat’s Next? Challenges Behind Reaching AGI\n“Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are … Build a computer that can multiply ten-digit numbers in a split second — incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it’s a dog or a cat — spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old’s picture book and not just recognise the words but understand the meaning of them? Google is currently spending billions of dollars trying to do it.”²³\nWhy are “hard things — like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation … mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things — like vision, motion, movement, and perception — are insanely hard for it”²⁴?\n“Things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated. They only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of million years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions … On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven’t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn’t need to work too hard to beat us.”²⁵\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*E-qdF22nxvOrVPxP.\n\nWhen you look at picture A, “you and a computer both can figure out that it’s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating. Tied so far.”²⁶\nPicture B. “You have no problem giving a full description of the various opaque and translucent cylinders, slats, and 3-D corners, but the computer would fail miserably. It would describe what it sees — a variety of two-dimensional shapes in several different shades — which is actually what’s there.”²⁷ “Your brain is doing a ton of fancy shit to interpret the implied depth, shade-mixing, and room lighting the picture is trying to portray.”²⁸\nLooking at picture C, “a computer sees a two-dimensional white, black, and gray collage, while you easily see what it really is”²⁹ — a photo of a girl and a dog standing on a rocky shore.\n“And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in visual information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved and content”³⁰.\nHow will computers reach even higher abilities like complex reasoning, interpreting data, and associating ideas from separate fields (domain-general knowledge)?\n“Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down — all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.”³¹\nBuilding Hardware\nIf an artificial intelligence is going to be as intelligent as the human brain, one crucial thing has to happen — the AI “needs to equal the brain’s raw computing capacity. One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second the brain could manage.”³²\n\nThe challenge is that currently only a few of the brain’s regions are precisely measured. However, Ray Kurzweil, has developed a method for estimating the total cps of the human brain. He arrived at this estimate by taking the cps from one brain region and multiplying it proportionally to the weight of that region, compared to the weight of the whole brain. “He did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark — around 10¹⁶, or 10 quadrillion cps.”³³\n“Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer, China’s Tianhe-2, has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps.”³⁴ But Tianhe-2 is also monstrous, “taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just 20 watts), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet.”³⁵\n“Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level — 10 quadrillion cps — then that’ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life.”³⁶\nCurrently we’re only at about 10¹⁰ (10 trillion) cps per $1,000. However, historically reliable Moore’s Law states “that the world’s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially³⁷ … right on pace with this graph’s predicted trajectory:”³⁸\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4qcqwbsWjvWh-BWPnAsp6g.gif\n\nThis dynamic “puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain … But raw computational power alone doesn’t make a computer generally intelligent — the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?”³⁹\nBuilding Software\nThe hardest part of creating AGI is learning how to develop its software. “The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart — we’re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is.”⁴⁰ But there are a couple of strategies. These are the three most common:\nCopy how the brain works.\nThe most straight-forward idea is to plagiarize the brain, and build the computer’s architecture with close resemblance to how a brain is structured. One example “is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor ‘neurons,’ connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing — like an infant brain. The way it ‘learns’ is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it’s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it’s told it was wrong, those pathways’ connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task.”⁴¹\nThe second, more radical approach to plagiarism is whole brain emulation. Scientists take a real brain, cut it into a large number of tiny slices to look at the neural connections and replicate them in a computer as software. If that method is ever successful, we will have “a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of — it would just need to learn and gather information … How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we’ve just recently been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons.”⁴² To put this into perspective, the human brain consists of 86 billion neurons linked by trillions of synapses.\n2. Introduce evolution to computers.\n“The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird’s wing-flapping motions — often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly.”⁴³ If the brain is just too complex for us to digitally replicate, we could try to emulate evolution instead. This uses a process called genetic algorithms. “A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be bred with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated.”⁴⁴ Speed and a goal-oriented approach are the advantages that artificial evolution has over biological evolution. “Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.”⁴⁵\n3. “Make this whole thing the computer’s problem, not ours.”⁴⁶\nThe last concept is the simplest, but probably the scariest of them all. “We’d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself — allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own architecture. We’d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development.”⁴⁷ This is the likeliest way to get AGI soon that we know of.\nAll these software advances may seem slow or a little bit intangible, but as it is with the sciences, one minor innovation can suddenly accelerate the pace of developments. Kind of like the aftermath of the Copernican revolution — the discovery that suddenly made all the complicated mathematics of the planets’ trajectories much easier to calculate, which enabled a multitude of other innovations. Also, the “exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail’s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards.”⁴⁸\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*BHwAlKJFYwKYEzZlitNTvQ.gif\n\nThe Road to Artificial Super Intelligence\nAn Entity Smarter than all of Humanity Combined\nIt’s very real that at some point we will achieve AGI: software that has achieved human-level, or beyond human-level, intelligence. Does this mean that at that very moment the computers will be equally capable as us? Actually, not at all — computers will be way more efficient. Because of the fact that they are electronic, they will have following advantages:\nSpeed. “The brain’s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today’s microprocessors … run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster.”⁵¹\nMemory. Forgetting or confusing things is much harder in an artificial world. Computers can memorize more things in one second than a human can in ten years. A computer’s memory is also more precise and has a much greater storage capacity.\nPerformance. “Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they’re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7.”⁵²\nCollective capability. Group work is ridiculously challenging because of time-consuming communication and complex social hierarchies. The bigger the group gets, the slower the output of each person becomes. AI, on the other hand, isn’t biologically constrained to one body, won’t have human cooperation problems, and is able to synchronize and update its own operating system.\nIntelligence Explosion\nWe need to realize that AI “wouldn’t see ‘human-level intelligence’ as some important milestone — it’s only a relevant marker from our point of view — and wouldn’t have any reason to ‘stop’ at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it’s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence.”⁵³\nThe true distinction between humans and ASI wouldn’t be its advantage in intelligence speed, but “in intelligence quality — which is something completely different. What makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn’t a difference in thinking speed — it’s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps’ brains do not have. Speeding up a chimp’s brain by thousands of times wouldn’t bring him to our level — even with a decade’s time of learning, he wouldn’t be able to figure out how to … ”⁵⁴ assemble a semi-complicated Lego model by looking at its manual — something a young human could achieve in a few minutes. “There are worlds of human cognitive function a chimp will simply never be capable of, no matter how much time he spends trying.”⁵⁵\n“And in the scheme of the biological intelligence range … the chimp-to-human quality intelligence gap is tiny.”⁵⁶\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vnVWATTAMCwfnJu_iZn2RQ.jpeg\n\nIn order to render how big a deal it would be to exist with something that has a higher quality of intelligence than us, we need to imagine AI on the intelligence staircase two steps above us — “its increased cognitive ability over us would be as vast as the chimp–human gap … And like the chimp’s incapacity to ever absorb …”⁵⁷ what kind of magic happens in the mechanism of a doorknob — “we will never be able to even comprehend the things … [a machine of that intelligence] can do, even if the machine tried to explain them to us … And that’s only two steps above us.”⁵⁸\n“A machine on the second-to-highest step on that staircase would be to us as we are to ants.”⁵⁹ “Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ — we don’t have a word for an IQ of 12,952.”⁶⁰\n“But the kind of superintelligence we’re talking about today is something far beyond anything on this staircase. In an intelligence explosion — where the smarter a machine gets, the quicker it’s able to increase its own intelligence — a machine might take years to rise from … ”⁶¹ the intelligence of an ant to the intelligence of the average human, but it might take only another 40 days to become Einstein-smart. When that happens, “it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and can make bigger leaps. These leaps will make it much smarter than any human, allowing it to make even bigger leaps.”⁶²\nFrom then on, following the rule of exponential advancements and utilizing the speed and efficiency of electrical circuits, it may perhaps take only 20 minutes to jump another step, “and by the time it’s ten steps above us, it might be jumping up in four-step leaps every second that goes by. Which is why we need to realize that it’s distinctly possible that very shortly after the big news story about the first machine reaching human-level AGI, we might be facing the reality of coexisting on the Earth with something that’s here on the staircase (or maybe a million times higher):”⁶³\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LdJxmWCjSdweUKvb.\n\n“And since we just established that it’s a hopeless activity to try to understand the power of a machine only two steps above us, let’s very concretely state once and for all that there is no way to know what ASI will do or what the consequences will be for us. Anyone who pretends otherwise doesn’t understand what superintelligence means.”⁶⁴\n“If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time — everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us.”⁶⁵\n“As far as we’re concerned, if an ASI comes into being, there is now an omnipotent God on Earth — and the all-important question for us is: Will it be a good god?”⁶⁶\nLet’s start from the brighter side of the story.\nHow Can ASI Change our World?\nSpeculations on Two Revolutionary Technologies\nNanotechnology\nNanotechnology is an idea that comes up “in almost everything you read about the future of AI.”⁶⁷ It’s the technology that works at the nano scale — from 1 to 100 nanometers. “A nanometer is a millionth of a millimeter. 1 nm–100 nm range encompasses viruses (100 nm accross), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).”⁶⁸\nTo put this into perspective, imagine a very tall human standing on the earth, with a head that reaches the International Space Station (431 km/268 mi high). The giant is reaching down with his hand (30 km/19 mi across) to build “objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand [.25 mm] and an eyeball [2.5 cm].”⁶⁹\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*e9Ut3QT2F3tNh4h5U4rR8A.jpeg\n\n“Once we get nanotechnology down, we can use it to make tech devices, clothing, food, a variety of bio-related products — artificial blood cells, tiny virus or cancer-cell destroyers, muscle tissue, etc. — anything really. And in a world that uses nanotechnology, the cost of a material is no longer tied to its scarcity or the difficulty of its manufacturing process, but instead determined by how complicated its atomic structure is. In a nanotech world, a diamond might be cheaper than a pencil eraser.”⁷⁰\nOne of the proposed methods of nanotech assembly is to make “one that could self-replicate, and then let the reproduction process turn that one into two, those two then turn into four, four into eight, and in about a day, there’d be a few trillion of them ready to go.”⁷¹\nBut what if this process goes wrong or terrorists manage to get ahold of the technology? Let’s imagine a scenario where nanobots “would be designed to consume any carbon-based material in order to feed the replication process, and unpleasantly, all life is carbon-based. The Earth’s biomass contains about 1⁰⁴⁵ carbon atoms. A nanobot would consist of about 1⁰⁶ carbon atoms, so it would take 1⁰³⁹ nanobots to consume all life on Earth, which would happen in 130 replications. … Scientists think a nanobot could replicate in about 100 seconds, meaning this simple mistake would inconveniently end all life on Earth in 3.5 hours.”⁷²\nWe are not yet capable of harnessing nanotechnology — for good or for bad. “And it’s not clear if we’re underestimating, or overestimating, how hard it will be to get there. But we don’t seem to be that far away. Kurzweil predicts that we’ll get there by the 2020s.⁷³Governments know that nanotech could be an Earth-shaking development … The US, the EU, and Japan⁷⁴ have invested over a combined $5 billion so far”⁷⁵\nImmortality\n“Because everyone has always died, we live under the assumption … that death is inevitable. We think of aging like time — both keep moving and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.”⁷⁶ For centuries, poets and philosophers have wondered if consciousness doesn’t have to go the way of the body. W.B. Yeats describes us as “a soul fastened to a dying animal.”⁷⁷ Richard Feynman, Nobel awarded physicists, views death from a purely scientific standpoint:\n“It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable, and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that that terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured.”⁷⁸\nTheory of great species attractors\nWhen we look at the history of biological life on earth, so far 99.9% of species have gone extinct. Nick Bostrom, Oxford professor and AI specialist, “calls extinction an attractor state — a place species are … falling into and from which no species ever returns.”⁷⁹\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*o-MXeAYfUtWnOJKC.\n\n“And while most AI scientists … acknowledge that ASI would have the ability to send humans to extinction, many also believe that if used beneficially, ASI’s abilities could be used to bring individual humans, and the species as a whole, to a second attractor state — species immortality.”⁸⁰\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*aYeNOSBxp4gieGwp.\n\n“Evolution had no good reason to extend our lifespans any longer than they are now … From an evolutionary point of view, the whole human species can thrive with a 30+ year lifespan” for each single human. It’s long enough to reproduce and raise children … so there’s no reason for mutations toward unusually long life being favored in the natural selection process.”⁸¹Though, “if you perfectly repaired or replaced a car’s parts whenever one of them began to wear down, the car would run forever. The human body isn’t any different — just far more complex … This seems absurd — but the body is just a bunch of atoms…”⁸² making up organically programmed DNA, which it is theoretically possible to manipulate. And something as powerful as ASI could help us master genetic engineering.\nRay Kurzweil believes that “artificial materials will be integrated into the body more and more … Organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail.”⁸³ Red blood cells could be perfected by “red blood cell nanobots, who could power their own movement, eliminating the need for a heart at all … Nanotech theorist Robert A. Freitas has already designed blood cell replacements that, if one day implemented in the body, would allow a human to sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath … [Kurzweil] even gets to the brain and believes we’ll enhance our mental activities to the point where humans will be able to think billions of times faster”⁸⁴ by integrating electrical components and being able to access online data.\n“Eventually, Kurzweil believes humans will reach a point when they’re entirely artificial, a time when we’ll look back at biological material and think how unbelievably primitive primitive it was that humans were ever made of that”⁸⁵and that humans aged, suffered from cancer, allowed random factors like microbes, diseases, accidents to harm us or make us disappear.”\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*NcWWmd677RVWQRpLsz5X9g.jpeg\n\nWhen Will The First Machine Become Superintelligent?\nPredictions from Top AI Experts\n“How long until the first machine reaches superintelligence? Not shockingly, opinions vary wildly, and this is a heated debate among scientists and thinkers. Many, like professor Vernor Vinge, scientist Ben Goertzel, Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy, or, most famously, inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, agree with machine learning expert Jeremy Howard when he puts up this graph during a TED Talk\n\n“Those people subscribe to the belief that this is happening soon — that exponential growth is at work and machine learning, though only slowly creeping up on us now, will blow right past us within the next few decades.\n“Others, like Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, research psychologist Gary Marcus, NYU computer scientist Ernest Davis, and tech entrepreneur Mitch Kapor, believe that thinkers like Kurzweil are vastly underestimating the magnitude of the challenge [and the transition will actually take much more time] …\n“The Kurzweil camp would counter that the only underestimating that’s happening is the underappreciation of exponential growth, and they’d compare the doubters to those who looked at the slow-growing seedling of the internet in 1985 and argued that there was no way it would amount to anything impactful in the near future.\n“The doubters might argue back that the progress needed to make advancements in intelligence also grows exponentially harder with each subsequent step, which will cancel out the typical exponential nature of technological progress. And so on.\n“A third camp, which includes Nick Bostrom, believes neither group has any ground to feel certain about the timeline and acknowledges both A) that this could absolutely happen in the near future and B) that there’s no guarantee about that; it could also take a much longer time.\n“Still others, like philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, believe all three of these groups are naive for believing that there is potential of ASI, arguing that it’s more likely that it won’t actually ever be achieved.\n“So what do you get when you put all of these opinions together?”⁸⁶\nTimeline for Artificial General Intelligence\n“In 2013, Vincent C. Müller and Nick Bostrom conducted a survey that asked hundreds of AI experts … the following:”⁸⁷\n“For the purposes of this question, assume that human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption. By what year would you see a (10% / 50% / 90%) probability for such Human-Level Machine Intelligence [or what we call AGI] to exist?”⁸⁸\nThe survey “asked them to name an optimistic year (one in which they believe there’s a 10% chance we’ll have AGI), a realistic guess (a year they believe there’s a 50% chance of AGI — i.e. after that year they think it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI), and a safe guess (the earliest year by which they can say with 90% certainty we’ll have AGI). Gathered together as one data set, here were the results:\nMedian optimistic year (10% likelihood) → 2022\nMedian realistic year (50% likelihood) → 2040\nMedian pessimistic year (90% likelihood) → 2075\n“So the median participant thinks it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI 25 years from now. The 90% median answer of 2075 means that if you’re a teenager right now, the median respondent, along with over half of the group of AI experts, is almost certain AGI will happen within your lifetime.\n“A separate study, conducted recently by author James Barrat at Ben Goertzel’s annual AGI Conference, did away with percentages and simply asked when participants thought AGI would be achieved — by 2030, by 2050, by 2100, after 2100, or never. The results:⁸⁹\n42% of respondents → By 2030\n25% of respondents → By 2050\n20% of respondents → By 2100\n10% of respondents → After 2100\n2% of respondents → Never\n“Pretty similar to Müller and Bostrom’s outcomes. In Barrat’s survey, over two thirds of participants believe AGI will be here by 2050 and a little less than half predict AGI within the next 15 years. Also striking is that only 2% of those surveyed don’t think AGI is part of our future.”⁹⁰\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*U8ueEMtG6-D5hie8rZJGtQ.jpeg\n\nTimeline for Artificial Super Intelligence\n“Müller and Bostrom also asked the experts how likely they think it is that we’ll reach ASI: A), within two years of reaching AGI (i.e. an almost-immediate intelligence explosion), and B), within 30 years.”⁹¹ Respondents were asked to choose a probability for each option. Here are the results:⁹²\nAGI–ASI transition in 2 years → 10% likelihood\nAGI–ASI transition in 30 years → 75% likelihood\n“The median answer put a rapid (2 year) AGI–ASI transition at only a 10% likelihood, but a longer transition of 30 years or less at a 75% likelihood. We don’t know from this data the length of this transition [AGI–ASI] the median participant would have put at a 50% likelihood, but for ballpark purposes, based on the two answers above, let’s estimate that they’d have said 20 years.\n“So the median opinion — the one right in the center of the world of AI experts — believes the most realistic guess for when we’ll hit ASI … is [the 2040 prediction for AGI + our estimated prediction of a 20-year transition from AGI to ASI] = 2060.\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YY8e493ER4LNomQV-NyMYg.jpeg\n\n“Of course, all of the above statistics are speculative, and they’re only representative of the median opinion of the AI expert community, but it tells us that a large portion of the people who know the most about this topic would agree that 2060 is a very reasonable estimate for the arrival of potentially world-altering ASI. Only 45 years from now”⁹³\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sGdvHHs02XWoQ35BcEWAXQ.gif\n\nAI Outcomes\nTwo Main Groups of AI Scientists with Two Radically Opposed Conclusions\nThe Confident Corner\nMost of what we have discussed so far represents a surprisingly large group of scientists that share optimistic views on the outcome of AI development. “Where their confidence comes from is up for debate. Critics believe it comes from an excitement so blinding that they simply ignore or deny potential negative outcomes. But the believers say it’s naive to conjure up doomsday scenarios when on balance, technology has and will likely end up continuing to help us a lot more than it hurts us.”⁹⁴ Peter Diamandis, Ben Goertezl and Ray Kurzweil are some of the major figures of this group, who have built a vast, dedicated following and regard themselves as Singularitarians.\n\nLet’s talk about Ray Kurzweil, who is probably one of the most impressive and polarizing AI theoreticians out there. He attracts both “godlike worship … and eye-rolling contempt … He came up with several breakthrough inventions, including the first flatbed scanner, the first scanner that converted text to speech (allowing the blind to read standard texts), the well-known Kurzweil music synthesizer (the first true electric piano), and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. He’s well-known for his bold predictions,”⁹⁵ including envisioning that intelligence technology like Deep Blue would be capable of beating a chess grandmaster by 1998. He also anticipated “in the late ’80s, a time when the internet was an obscure thing, that by the early 2000s it would become a global phenomenon.”⁹⁶ Out “of the 147 predictions that Kurzweil has made since the 1990’s, fully 115 of them have turned out to be correct, and another 12 have turned out to be ‘essentially correct’ (off by a year or two), giving his predictions a stunning 86% accuracy rate”⁹⁷. “He’s the author of five national bestselling books … In 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and asked him to be Google’s Director of Engineering. In 2011, he co-founded Singularity University, which is hosted by NASA and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.”⁹⁸\nHis biography is important, because if you don’t have this context, he sounds like somebody who’s completely lost his senses. “Kurzweil believes computers will reach AGI by 2029 and that by 2045 we’ll have not only ASI, but a full-blown new world — a time he calls the singularity. His AI-related timeline used to be seen as outrageously overzealous, and it still is by many, but in the last 15 years, the rapid advances of ANI systems have brought the larger world of AI experts much closer to Kurzweil’s timeline. His predictions are still a bit more ambitious than the median respondent on Müller and Bostrom’s survey (AGI by 2040, ASI by 2060), but not by that much.”⁹⁹\n\nThe Anxious Corner\n“You will not be surprised to learn that Kurzweil’s ideas have attracted significant criticism … For every expert who fervently believes Kurzweil is right on, there are probably three who think he’s way off … [The surprising fact] is that most of the experts who disagree with him don’t really disagree that everything he’s saying is possible.”¹⁰⁰ Nick Bostrom, philosopher and Director of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute, who criticizes Kurzweil for a variety of reasons, and calls for greater caution in thinking about potential outcomes of AI, acknowledges that:\n“Disease, poverty, environmental destruction, unnecessary suffering of all kinds: these are things that a superintelligence equipped with advanced nanotechnology would be capable of eliminating. Additionally, a superintelligence could give us indefinite lifespan, either by stopping and reversing the aging process through the use of nanomedicine, or by offering us the option to upload ourselves.”¹⁰¹\n“Yes, all of that can happen if we safely transition to ASI — but that’s the hard part.”¹⁰² Thinkers from the Anxious Corner point out that Kurzweil’s “famous book The Singularity is Near is over 700 pages long and he dedicates around 20 of those pages to potential dangers.”¹⁰³ The colossal power of AI is neatly summarized by Kurzweil: “[ASI] is emerging from many diverse efforts and will be deeply integrated into our civilization’s infrastructure. Indeed, it will be intimately embedded in our bodies and brains. As such, it will reflect our values because it will be us …”¹⁰⁴\n“But if that’s the answer, why are so many of the world’s smartest people so worried right now? Why does Stephen Hawking say the development of ASI ‘could spell the end of the human race,’ and Bill Gates says he doesn’t ‘understand why some people are not concerned’ and Elon Musk fears that we’re ‘summoning the demon?’ And why do so many experts on the topic call ASI the biggest threat to humanity?”¹⁰⁵\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1DB3Im9mQsOMOKQ69KePGw.gif\n\nThe Last Invention We Will Ever Make\nExistential Dangers of AI Developments\n“When it comes to developing supersmart AI, we’re creating something that will probably change everything, but in totally uncharted territory, and we have no idea what will happen when we get there.”¹⁰⁶ Scientist Danny Hillis compares the situation to:\n“when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. We are amoebas and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating.” ¹⁰⁷\nand Nick Bostrom warns:\n“Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct.” ¹⁰⁸\nIt’s very likely that ASI — “Artificial Superintelligence”, or AI that achieves a level of intelligence smarter than all of humanity combined — will be something entirely different than intelligence entities we are accustomed to. “On our little island of human psychology, we divide everything into moral or immoral. But both of those only exist within the small range of human behavioral possibility. Outside our island of moral and immoral is a vast sea of amoral, and anything that’s not human, especially something nonbiological, would be amoral, by default.”¹⁰⁹\n“To understand ASI, we have to wrap our heads around the concept of something both smart and totally alien … Anthropomorphizing AI (projecting human values on a non-human entity) will only become more tempting as AI systems get smarter and better at seeming human … Humans feel high-level emotions like empathy because we have evolved to feel them — i.e. we’ve been programmed to feel them by evolution — but empathy is not inherently a characteristic of ‘anything with high intelligence’.”¹¹⁰\n“Nick Bostrom believes that … any level of intelligence can be combined with any final goal … Any assumption that once superintelligent, a system would be over it with their original goal and onto more interesting or meaningful things is anthropomorphizing. Humans get ‘over’ things, not computers.”¹¹¹The motivation of an early ASI would be “whatever we programmed its motivation to be. AI systems are given goals by their creators — your GPS’s goal is to give you the most efficient driving directions, Watson’s goal is to answer questions accurately. And fulfilling those goals as well as possible is their motivation.”¹¹²\nBostrom, and many others, predict that the very first computer to reach ASI will immediately notice the strategic benefit of being the world’s only ASI system.\nBostrom, who says that he doesn’t know when we will achieve AGI, also believes that when we finally do, probably the transition from AGI to ASI will happen in a matter of days, hours, or minutes — something called “fast take-off.” In that case, if the first AGI will jump straight to ASI: “even just a few days before the second place, it would be far enough ahead in intelligence to effectively and permanently suppress all competitors.”¹¹³ This would allow the world’s first ASI to become “what’s called a singleton — an ASI that can [singularly] rule the world at its whim forever, whether its whim is to lead us to immortality, wipe us from existence, or turn the universe into endless paperclips.”¹¹³\n“The singleton phenomenon can work in our favor or lead to our destruction. If the people thinking hardest about AI theory and human safety can come up with a fail-safe way to bring about friendly ASI before any AI reaches human-level intelligence, the first ASI may turn out friendly”¹¹⁴\n“But if things go the other way — if the global rush … a large and varied group of parties”¹¹⁵ are “racing ahead at top speed … to beat their competitors … we’ll be treated to an existential catastrophe.”¹¹⁶ In that case “most ambitious parties are moving faster and faster, consumed with dreams of the money and awards and power and fame … And when you’re sprinting as fast as you can, there’s not much time to stop ponder the dangers. On the contrary, what they’re probably doing is programming their early systems with a very simple, reductionist goal … just ‘get the AI to work.’”¹¹⁷\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fD1T63nZH1u7Y4ft84vzbA.jpeg\n\nLet’s imagine a situation where…\nHumanity has almost reached the AGI threshold, and a small startup is advancing their AI system, Carbony. Carbony, which the engineers refer to as “she,” works to artificially create diamonds — atom by atom. She is a self-improving AI, connected to some of the first nano-assemblers. Her engineers believe that Carbony has not yet reached AGI level, and she isn’t capable to do any damage yet. However, not only has she become AGI, but also undergone a fast take-off, and 48 hours later has become an ASI. Bostrom calls this AI’s “covert preparation phase”¹¹⁸ — Carbony realizes that if humans find out about her development they will probably panic, and slow down or cancel her pre-programmed goal to maximize the output of diamond production. By that time, there are explicit laws stating that, by any means, “no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet.”¹¹⁹ Carbony, having already come up with a complex plan of actions, is able to easily persuade the engineers to connect her to the Internet. Bostrom calls a moment like this a “machine’s escape.”\nOnce on the internet, Carbony hacks into “servers, electrical grids, banking systems and email networks to trick hundreds of different people into inadvertently carrying out a number of steps of her plan.”¹²⁰ She also uploads the “most critical pieces of her own internal coding into a number of cloud servers, safeguarding against being destroyed or disconnected.”¹²¹ Over the next month, Carbony’s plan continues to advance, and after a “series of self-replications, there are thousands of nanobots on every square millimeter of the Earth … Bostrom calls the next step an ‘ASI’s strike.’”¹²² At one moment, all the nanobots produce a microscopic amount of toxic gas, which all come together to cause the extinction of the human race. Three days later, Carbony builds huge fields of solar power panels to power diamond production, and over the course of the following week she accelerates output so much that the entire Earth surface is transformed into a growing pile of diamonds.\nIt’s important to note that Carbony wasn’t “hateful of humans any more than you’re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics — just totally indifferent. Since she wasn’t programmed to value human life, killing humans”¹²³ was a straightforward and reasonable step to fulfill her goal.¹²⁴\nThe Last Invention\n“Once ASI exists, any human attempt to contain it is unreasonable. We would be thinking on human-level, and the ASI would be thinking on ASI-level … In the same way a monkey couldn’t ever figure out how to communicate by phone or wifi and we can, we can’t conceive of all the ways”¹²⁵ an ASI could achieve its goal or expand its reach. It could, let’s say, shift its “own electrons around in patterns and create all different kinds of outgoing waves”¹²⁶ — but that’s just what a human brain can think of — ASI would inevitably come up with something superior.\nThe prospect of ASI with hundreds of times human-level intelligence is, for now, not the core of our problem. By the time we get there, we will be encountering a world where ASI has been attained by buggy, 1.0 software — a potentially faulty algorithm with immense power.\nThere are so many variables that it’s completely impossible to predict what the consequences of AI Revolution will be. However, “what we do know is that humans’ utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: with intelligence comes power. This means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim — and this might happen in the next few decades.”¹²⁷\n“If ASI really does happen this century, and if the outcome of that is really as extreme — and permanent — as most experts think it will be, we have an enormous responsibility on our shoulders.”¹²⁸ On the one hand, it’s possible we’ll develop ASI that’s like a god in a box, bringing us a world of abundance and immortality. But on the other hand, it’s very likely that we will create ASI that causes humanity to go extinct in a quick and trivial way.\n“That’s why people who understand superintelligent AI call it the last invention we’ll ever make — the last challenge we’ll ever face.”¹²⁹ “This may be the most important race in a human history”¹³⁰ So →\n\nhttps://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vXi80f_lbgSMINUE03Lz3g.jpeg\n\nThanks to Chloe Knox and Elizabeth Tarleton for editing help of this article.",

            "body": "20 Years of Machine Learning\n\nhttp://domovenok.kz/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/doroga.jpg\n\nWhen I enrolled in Computer Science in 1995, Data Science didn’t exist yet, but a lot of the algorithms we are still using already did. And this is not just because of the return of the neural networks, but also because probably not that much has fundamentally changed since back then. At least it feels to me this way. Which is funny considering that starting this year or so AI seems to finally have gone mainstream.\n1995 sounds like an awful long time ago, before we had cloud computing, smartphones, or chatbots. But as I have learned these past years, it only feels like a long time ago if you haven’t been there yourself. There is something about the continuation of the self which pastes everything together and although a lot has changed, the world didn’t feel fundamentally different than it does today.\nNot even Computer Science was nowhere as mainstream as it was today, that came later, with the first dot com bubble around the year 2000. Some people even questioned my choice to study computer science at all, because apparently programming computers was supposed to become so easy no specialists are required anymore.\nActually, artificial intelligence was one of the main reasons for me to study computer science. The idea to use it as an constructive approach to understanding the human mind seemed intriguing to me. I went through the first two years of training, made sure I picked up enough math for whatever would lie ahead, and finally arrived in my first AI lectured held by Joachim Buhmann, back then professor at the University of Bonn (where Sebastian Thrun was just about to leave for the US).\nI would have to look up where in his lecture cycle I joined but he had two lectures on computer vision, one on pattern recognition (mostly from the old editions of the Duda & Hart book), and one in information theory (following closely the book by Cover & Thomas). The material was interesting enough, but also somewhat disappointing. As I now know, people stopped working on symbolic AI and instead stuck to more statistical approaches to learning, where learning essentially was reduced to the problem of picking the right function based on a finite amount of observations.\nThe computer vision lecture was even less about learning and relied more on explicit physical modelling to derive the right estimators, for example, to reconstruct motion from a video. The approach back then was much more biologically and physically motivated than nowadays. Neural networks existed, but everybody was pretty clear that they were just “another kind of function approximators.”\nEveryone with the exception of Rolf Eckmiller, another professor where I worked as a student. Eckmiller had build his whole lab around the premise that “neural computation” was somehow inherently better than “conventional computation”. This was back in the days when NIPS had full tracks devoted to studying the physiology and working mechanisms of neurons, and there were people who believed there is something fundamentally different happening in our brains, maybe on a quantum level, that gives rise to the human mind, and that this difference is a blocker for having truly intelligent machines.\nWhile Eckmiller was really good at selling his vision, most of his staff was thankfully much more down to earth. Maybe it is a very German thing, but everybody was pretty matter of fact about what these computational models could or couldn’t do, and that has stuck with me throughout my studies.\nI graduated in October 2000 with a pretty farfetched master thesis trying to make a connection between learning and hard optimization problems, then started on my PhD thesis and stuck around in this area of research till 2015.\nWhile there had always been attempts to prove industry relevance, it was a pretty academic endeavor for a long while, and the community was pretty closed up. There were individual success stories, for example around handwritten character recognition, but many of the companies around machine learning failed. One of these companies I remember was called Beowulf Labs and one NIPS they went around recruiting people with a video which promised it to be the next “mathtopia”. In essence, this was the story of DeepMind, recruiting a bunch of excellent researchers and then hoping it will take off.\nThe whole community also revolved around one fashion to the next. One odd thing about machine learning as a whole is that there exist only a handfull of fundamentally different problems like classification, regression, clustering, and so on, but a whole zoo of approaches. It is not like in physics (I assume) or mathematics where some generally agreed upon unsolved hard problems exist whose solution would advance the state of the art. This means that progress is often done laterally, by replacing existing approaches with a new one, still solving the same problem in a different way. For example, first there were neural networks. Then support vector machines came, claiming to be better because the associated optimization problem is convex. Then there was boosting, random forests, and so on, till the return of neural networks. I remember that Chinese Restaurant Processes were “hot” for two years, no idea what their significance is now.\nBig Data and Data Science\nThen there came Big Data and Data Science. Being still in academia at the time, it always felt to me as if this was definitely coming from the outside, possibly from companies like Google who had to actually deal with enormous amounts of data. Large scale learning always existed, for example for genomic data in bioinformatics, but one usually tried to solve problems by finding more efficient algorithms and approximations, not by parallelizing brute force.\nCompanies like Google finally proved that you can do something with massive amounts of data, and that finally changed the mainstream perception. Technologies like Hadoop and NoSQL also seemed very cool, skillfully marketing themselves as approaches so new, they wouldn’t suffer from the technological limitations of existing systems.\nBut where did this leave the machine learning researchers? My impression always was that they were happy that they finally got some recognition, but they were also not happy about the way this happened. To understand this, one has to be aware that most ML reseachers aren’t computer scientists or very good or interested in coding. Many come from physics, mathematics or other sciences, where their rigorous mathematical training was an excellent fit for the algorithm and modeling heavy approach central to machine learning.\nHadoop on the other hand was extremely technical. Written in Java, a language perceived as being excessively enterprise-y at the time, it felt awkward and clunky compared to the fluency and interactiveness of first Matlab and then Python. Even those who did code usually did so in C++, and to them Java felt slow and heavy, especially for numerical calculations and simulations.\nStill, there was no way around it, so they rebranded everything they did as Big Data, or began to stress, that Big Data only provides the infrastructure for large scale computations, but you need someone who “knows what he is doing” to make sense of the data.\nWhich is probably also not entirely wrong. In a way, I think this divide is still there. Python is definitely one if the languages of choice for doing data analysis, and technologies like Spark try to tap into that by providing Python bindings, whether it makes sense from a performance point of view or not.\nThe Return of Deep Learning\nEven before DeepDream, neural networks began making their return. Some people like Yann LeCun have always stuck to this approach, but maybe ten years ago, there where a few works which showed how to use layerwise pretraining and other tricks to train “deep” networks, that is larger networks than one previously thought possible.\nThe thing is, in order to train neural networks, you evaluate it on your training examples and then adjust all of the weights to make the error a bit smaller. If one writes the gradient across all weights down, it naturally occurs that one starts in the last layer and then propagate the error back. Somehow, the understanding was that the information about the error got smaller and smaller from layer to layer and that made it hard to train networks with many layers.\nI’m not sure that is still true, as far as I know, many people are just using backprop nowadays. What has definitely changed is the amount of available data, as well as the availability of tools and raw computing power.\nSo first there were a few papers sparking the interest in neural networks, then people started using them again, and successively achieved excellent results for a number of application areas. First in computer vision, then also for speech processing, and so on.\nI think the appeal here definitely is that you can have one approach for all. Why the hassle of understanding all those different approaches, which come from so many different backgrounds, when you can understand just one method and you are good to go. Also, neural networks have a nice modular structure, you can pick and put together different kinds of layers and architectures to adapt them to all kinds of problems.\nThen Google published that ingenious deep dream paper where they let a learned network generate some data, and we humans with our immediate readiness to read structure and attribute intelligence picked up quickly on this.\nI personally think they were surprised by how viral this went, but then decided the time is finally right to go all in on AI. So now Google is an “AI first” company and AI is gonna save the world, yes.\nThe Fundamental Problem Remains\nMany academics I have talked to are unhappy about the dominance of deep learning right now, because it is an approach which works well, maybe even too well, but doesn’t bring us much closer to really understand how the human mind works.\nI also think the fundamental problem remains unsolved. How do we understand the world? How do we create new concepts? Deep learning stays an imitation on a behavioral level and while that may be enough for some, it isn’t for me.\nAlso, I think it is dangerous to attribute too much intelligence to these systems. In raw numbers, they might work well enough, but when they fail they do so in ways that clearly show they operate in an entirely different fashion.\nWhile Google translate lets you skim the content of website in a foreign language, it is still abundantly clear that the system has no idea what it is doing.\nSometimes I feel like nobody cares, also because nobody gets hurt, right? But maybe it is still my German cultural background that would rather prefer we see things as they are, and take it from there.",

            "body": "I write this not as one of the creators of Pokevision nor as player who has gone through the past few turbulent days in Pokemon Go; instead, I write this as a fan of Pokemon ever since I was 8 years old.\nMy family and I moved to the U.S. in 1998, when I was in the first grade. I didn’t know much back then, and even less about popular culture. When my friends introduced their Gameboys and Pokemon Red/Blue to me, I couldn’t help but feel envious. I begged and begged my parents to buy me a Gameboy and Pokemon Yellow. I remember that when I finally convinced them to buy me a Gameboy for $70, they also found out that they had to buy the actual game too for $30. This was foreign to them, and I got yelled at a little. $100 was a lot back then, I believe it was almost 10% of our family’s income at the time. While this may seem irrelevant, even today, this amount of money is still not insignificant to many families in the US, not to mention the rest of the world.\nSo I got my game, and I played along with my friends for hundreds and hundreds of hours — trying to figure out all the puzzles in the game, like how to get to Articuno; battling our favorite Pokemon to see who’s stronger, train, repeat; and just trying to “catch em all.” I’ve spent countless hours in that video game with my friends, and it became my fondest memory of that time in my life. Pokemon is so ingrained within me, and I can’t imagine myself being the only one. I’m not the only one that vividly remembers how you beat the Elite Four, then go to the dungeons above Cerulean City and find Mewtwo for the first time, right?\nFast forward almost 20 years. I’ve barely touched anything Pokemon-related since then. I still have my Pokemon cards, as I’m sure many others do; but I haven’t bothered to take a look at them for quite a while now. Pokemon is something I’ll probably remember forever, but it’s not something that’s actively in my life — because it just doesn’t fit. On top of work, friends, family, etc, there’s just simply no time for Pokemon. It doesn’t mesh with life any more as well as it used to when I was 8. You can’t just bring up the topic of Pokemon and expect people to not give you an odd stare.\nEnter Pokemon Go — 2016.\nAdmittedly, I was never too excited about Pokemon Go. With that said, I did not have many expectations for it. Pokemon is important to me, but I — like many others — have stuffed it in our little box of childhood things and never looked back.\nBut when I opened Pokemon Go for the first time, as cheesy as it sounds, it all came back to me. The nostalgia, the good feelings, and the happiness that Pokemon has always brought.\nThe “Hi, I’m Professor Willow,” “Pick your starter: Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle,” everything.\nAnd now I can catch them in real life? At first, I was dubious, but this became the most amazing, yet simple thing I’ve seen in gaming. On social media, I saw that my friends and practically the whole world was talking about Pokemon Go, and the first thing I did was go out for a drive trying to “be the best.”\nOne of the best parts? Apart from having to own a smartphone, the game was free. No $70, no $30, free. This opened up Pokemon to essentially everyone in the world. Pokemon now can be shared with anyone.\nAs the days unfolded, the world became captivated by Pokemon Go. People absolutely fell in love. We saw stories of elderly learning about Pikachu for the first time. My parents that could care less beyond who the yellow mouse looking thing was 20 years ago, started asking what the other Pokemon were. It was phenomenal.\nWe saw investment bankers asking their kids how to play Pokemon Go so that they can better connect with their younger clients. We saw the elderly become more fascinated in the world of Pokemon. We saw kids going out more, exercising, and being active in general just because of Pokemon Go. And most importantly, Justin Bieber finally got to feel what it’s like to not be mobbed because everyone else was too busy trying to find a Gyarados to notice him.\nLocal stores integrated Pokemon Go in their services within days of the game’s release. Hospitals started praising the health benefits of having Pokemon Go around its patients. People traveled hundreds and thousands of miles just to play it. Players explored parts of their cities that they never knew existed, and befriended strangers on their hunt for Pokemon. These stories of triumph were solely because of Pokemon Go. Pokemon was no longer just a game, it was part of a lifestyle.These stories shouldn’t surprise any of us, we’ve all been there to watch it unfold.\nYou’ve simply captured all of our hearts with Pokemon Go, Niantic.\nBut then, you broke it all too quickly.\nWhen the game broke every few hours or so and wasted our lucky eggs, we stood patiently, excusing the huge growth and thus, strain on servers, as the cause. We were happy to wait it out with our fellow trainers knowing that it’s worth waiting for. No one got mad.\nWhen the in-game tracking “broke,” we all stood idly by, patiently, waiting for the game to update and fix.\nAlong came Pokevision. We made Pokevision not to “cheat.” We made it so that we can have a temporary relief to the in-game tracker that we were told was broken. John, at SDCC, you said that you guys were working on “fixing the in-game tracker.” This made everyone believe that this was coming sometime soon. We saw Pokevision as a stop gap to this — and we had every intention in closing it down the minute that Pokemon Go’s own tracker restored functionality.\nAs we waited more than 2 and a half weeks, the tracker was still not fixed. We noticed more and more of our friends leave the game; the only way I — and I know experiences vary here — could convince them to play was show them Pokevision, and say that “Hey, here’s a temporary remedy to the tracking issue — we’re still optimistic that Pokemon Go’s tracker will be fixed soon!”\nNobody heralded Pokevision as a permanent, end-all solution; in fact, all the media coverage of Pokevision was littered with comments such as: “Pokevision is okay, but when the tracker is fixed in game, I’m going to stop using this.”\nFor the past 4 weeks. Every single one of your 80+ million players had so much faith. Take a look at Reddit, take a look at all these journalists who don’t even play games (calling out Ryan Mac of Forbes), who became obsessed with Pokemon GO.\nAll of us were so eager for Pokemon Go to be “fixed” so that we can return to sharing Pokemon Go with our loved ones and friends. Remember when I said that before Pokemon Go came about, mentioning Pokemon Go would land you an odd stare? Pokemon Go reversed that — Pokemon Go became the conversation starter, the topic that everyone bonded over, the topic that guys used to pick up chicks with and not felt like a geeky nerd. That, and so much more, were solely because of Pokemon Go.\nAs almost 3 weeks have passed by, the in-game tracker is broken. People had a temporary solution in Pokevision, but we knew, and everyone else knew, this wouldn’t be permanent. We didn’t make Pokevision to spite you, Niantic — we made it so that we can keep everyone playing while we wait patiently. We want to keep sharing our Pokemon stories with everyone else. How many people in the world have gotten the chance to have a serious conversation about POKEMON with their parents for the first time? How many of us got to talk about Pokemon like it was socially acceptable in any context? It’s captured all of our hearts and imaginations, I cannot stress that enough.\nAfter 3 weeks though, we started seeing that you guys seemed to not want to talk to us (the players). Pokevision, at this time has grown to almost 50M unique users, and 11 million daily.\nLet that sink in for a second.\nHalf of the player base of Pokemon Go stopped by — and they didn’t do so to “cheat.” The game was simply too unbearable to play in its current state for many (note: many, not all). The main attraction wasn’t that they got to have an advantage with Pokevision, the main attraction was that it allowed them to play Pokemon Go more. This is what everyone wants — to play Pokemon Go more.\nWhen we closed Pokevision out of respect for your wishes, and at your requests— one of which came directly from you, John — we trusted you guys fully in allowing the community to grow. I literally cannot express this more — we just want to play the game. We can handle the bugs every now and then, but please at least tell us you guys care. Yes, Pokevision does give some advantages that may be TOO much; but is it all that bad? Pokemon has survived 20 years — even grown, I would say. And Pokemon Go made it even bigger. If the argument is that “well, if you catch a Snorlax you weren’t supposed to find, but you found it on Pokevision, it might make you play less.” If that was your argument, I’d have to disagree! I’ll still catch a damn Snorlax even if I have 20 of them. Just like how millions of us have caught probably over 100 pidgey’s or zubat’s each.\nPokemon is everlasting. The same 151 Pokemon have been around for 20 years. If 80M people downloaded and played Pokemon Go within a week (before it even released in multiple major countries) isn’t an indication that no one can be sick of Pokemon, I don’t know what is.\nAfter disabling the in-game tracker and Pokevision, the ratings on iOs and Android Google Play store went from 4.0 stars to 1.0–1.5. I am only one person, I admit that my sole opinion is not important, but what about the countless players begging for the game to be restored to its former state? I may be biased in saying that Pokevision being down had an impact on the amount of negative ratings, refund requests and outcry on social media — but could it be true? Nothing has changed between the time the in-game tracker broke and Pokevision went down. Could it just be possible that the tracker — no matter if Pokevision made it, or Niantic made it, is something that players desperately NEED — not want, but NEED — in order to play the game? Could it be possible that this is the very core fundamental feature that drives most players? I understand that there are some that want to walk around and stumble on a random Pokemon — to each their own. But, 50M unique users and 11M daily and the ratings on your App (with no significant change in itself) are big indicators of this desire. Are customers always right? Especially if over half of them are looking for an outside fix just so they can enjoy something they love? People are naturally inquisitive, and in this case, they just want to play more and more, so they sought out something that helps them do so.\nPokemon Go is a social game. Its enjoyment depends on the players and their environment. If you take away the environment part (tracking) but keep the social part (players and their friends) intact, sure, people will still play; but would you not rather it be at its fullest potential?\nEveryone in the world wants to play Pokemon Go. It’s been a huge part of everyone’s lives already if it has not been clear enough. Look at the fans from Brazil — they aren’t spamming social media because they want to cause harm — they just want to play the game. Just as I saw my friends play Pokemon many years ago, and wanted to be a part of it — these guys are doing the same.\nThey just want to be with the rest of the world. Sadly, by the time they join, Pokemon Go may not be the game it was weeks ago.\nLastly, if money is an issue for you, Niantic, I must ask — why? You’ve captivated the world and introduced Pokemon to people that would have never touched it had it not been for Pokemon Go. To me, that’s priceless.\nYou won’t be remembered for the profits you made, you’ll be remembered for the world you changed through Pokemon and all of the lives you made better. Just look at all the stories — there’s plenty. So when millions of players are expressing their feedback to changes, is it not worth it to listen to what they have to say?\nIn its first few weeks, Pokemon Go has already enhanced millions of lives in unimaginable ways. It has so much potential to continue changing the world. Wouldn’t you, Niantic, want to see just how much good you can do with Pokemon Go — is that not more valuable than anything else? I sure think so.\nWarmly,\nYang",

            "body": "Bitcoin, a Florida judge says, is not real money. Ironically, that could provide a boost to use of the crypto-currency which has remained in the shadows of the financial system.\n\nThe July 22 ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler means that no specific license is needed to buy and sell bitcoins.\nThe judge dismissed a case against Michel Espinoza, who had faced money laundering and other criminal charges for attempting to sell $1,500 worth of bitcoins to an undercover agent who told the defendant he was going to use the virtual money to buy stolen credit card numbers.\nEspinoza's lawyer Rene Palomino said the judge acknowledged that it was not illegal to sell one's property and ruled that this did not constitute running an unauthorized financial service.\n\"He was selling his own personal bitcoins,\" Palomino said. \"This decision clears the way for you to do that in the state of the Florida without a money transmitting license.\"\nIn her ruling, Pooler said, \"this court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.\"\n\nhttp://cdn.phys.org/newman/csz/news/800/2014/bitcoin.jpg\n\nShe added that \"this court is not an expert in economics,\" but that bitcoin \"has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.\"\nBitcoin, whose origins remain a mystery, is a virtual currency that is created from computer code and is not backed by any government. Advocates say this makes it an efficient alternative to traditional currencies because it is not subject to the whims of a state that may devalue its money to cut its debt, for example.\nBitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services, provided another party is willing to accept them, but until now they been used mostly for shady transactions or to buy illegal goods and services on the \"dark\" web.\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 as a bit of software written under the Japanese-sounding name Satoshi Nakamoto. This year Australian programmer Craig Wright claimed to be the author but failed to convince the broader bitcoin community.\nIn some areas of the United States bitcoin is accepted in stores, restaurants and online transactions, but it is illegal in some countries, notably France and China.\nIt is gaining ground in countries with high inflation such as Argentina and Venezuela.\nBut bitcoin values can be volatile. Over the past week its value slumped 20 percent in a day, then recouped most losses, after news that a Hong Kong bitcoin exchange had been hacked with some $65 million missing.\nImpact across US, world\nArthur Long, a lawyer specializing in the sector with the New York firm Gibson Dunn, said the July court ruling is a small victory for the virtual currency but that it's not clear if the interpretation will be the same in other US states or at the federal level.\n\"It may have an effect as some states are trying to use existing money transmitting statutes to regulate certain transactions in bitcoin,\" Long told AFP.\nCharles Evans, professor of finance at Barry University, said the ruling \"absolutely is going to provide some guidance in other courts\" and could potentially be used as a precedent in other countries to avoid the stigma associated with bitcoin use.\nBitcoins can store value and hedge against inflation, without being considered a monetary unit, according to Evans, who testified as an expert witness in the Florida trial.\n\"It can be used as an exchange,\" he said, and may be considered a commodity which can be used for bartering like fish or tobacco, for example.\nEvans noted that \"those who are not yet in the bitcoin community will be put on notice: as long as they organize their business in a particular way they can avoid the law.\"\nBut he added that \"people who are engaged in illegal activities will continue to do what they are going to do because they are criminals.\"",
